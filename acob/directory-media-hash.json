Dr. Zhang’s research agenda lies at the intersection of financial markets and banking, and it can be classified in the following broad groups which are highly interrelated: 1) mortgage lending and financial markets, 2) the banking system, and 3) the interaction with the real economy. His research examines credit supply and implications of mortgage lending in microdata to shed light on how financial intermediaries allocate credit across consumers and the determinants of loan terms. Prior to joining UTSA, Dr. Zhang was an assistant professor of finance and McMurry Junior Research Fellow at the University of Wyoming.</p>\n<h3><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Banking</li>\n<li>Mortgage Lending</li>\n<li>FinTech</li>\n<li>Corporate Finance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Selected Publications</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“Uniform Mortgage Regulation and Distortion in Capital Allocation”, <em>Review of Finance</em>, Vol. 26, No. 4, 2022, pp. 1011-1050.</li>\n<li>“Political Influence and Banks: Evidence from Mortgage Lending” with Yongqiang Chu, <em>Journal of Financial Intermediation,</em> Vol. 52, 2022, 100982.</li>\n</ul>\n",
