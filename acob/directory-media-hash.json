In particular, his research endeavors are focused on improving access to essential health commodities (e.g., contraceptives, antimalarials, HIV medication) in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs). For individuals who are deprived of access to such essential health commodities, the consequences can be dire. For example, without reliable access to contraceptives, women may suffer unintended pregnancies, imposing economic and psychological burden, and adverse health outcomes including injuries, infections, and even deaths. HIV patients unable to obtain antiretrovirals may face delays in treatment initiation and interruptions during the treatment process, subsequently increasing the risk of viral resistance, treatment failure, and mortality.</p>\n<p>Focusing on this context, Karimi&#8217;s research aims to:<br />\n(i) Empirically evaluate and uncover the factors that contribute to health commodity stock-outs in developing countries by leveraging field data and using a combination of rigorous econometric and predictive modeling techniques;<br />\n(ii) Generate actionable insights that public health organizations, governments, and donors can use to mitigate the risk of stock-outs in developing countries.</p>\n<h3><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Health</li>\n<li>Healthcare Supply Chains</li>\n<li>Socially Responsible Supply Chains</li>\n<li>Empirical Analysis</li>\n<li>Advanced Econometrics</li>\n<li>Predictive Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","department":["management science and statistics"],"roles":["faculty"]},"13724":{"first_name":"Isil","last_name":"Koyuncu","faculty_title":"Assistant Professor of Management Science and Statistics","faculty_email":"isil.koyuncu@utsa.edu","faculty_phone":"210-458-5065","faculty_fax":"","faculty_office_number":"SPI 260L- San Pedro I, 506 Dolorosa St.","faculty_pdf":"","faculty_additional_info":"","department_role_repeater":[{"department":"Management Science and Statistics","role":"Faculty"}],"uri":"isil-koyuncu-ph-d","fullname":"Isil Koyuncu, Ph.D.","id":13724,"status":"publish","link":"https://business.utsa.edu/faculty/isil-koyuncu-ph-d/","json":"https://business.utsa.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/faculty/13724","media":[{"id":18583,"alt":"","path":"uploads/2020/08/Koyuncu_Isil_9143-e1627421989662.jpg","correctedPath":"faculty/headshots/management-science-and-statistics/13724-isil-koyuncu-ph-d.jpg"}],"topd":"Management Science and Statistics","dslug":"management-science-and-statistics","content":"","department":["management science and statistics"],"roles":["faculty"]},"13963":{"first_name":"Prince","last_name":"Buti","faculty_title":"Doctoral Student -

Prior to Fudan, she received her bachelor&#8217;s degree in Statistics from East China Normal University.</p>\n<p>The central theme of her research has been trying to develop new statistical methods to analyze complex data and draw valid conclusions from these. Motivated by many real-world problems, her research has focused on (1) identifying and estimating causal effects in some complicated situations; (2) model selection and post-selection inference; and (3) developing robust statistical inference methods for complex longitudinal data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/yuexia-zhang/.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Personal Website</strong></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Causal inference</li>\n<li>Microbiome data analysis</li>\n<li>Missing data</li>\n<li>Robust estimation</li>\n<li>Post-selection inference</li>\n<li>Longitudinal data analysis</li>\n<li>Measurement error</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Selected Publications</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“Weak Signal Identification and Inference in Penalized Likelihood Models for Categorical Responses,” with Peibei Shi, Zhongyi Zhu, Linbo Wang and Annie Qu, <em>Statistics Sinica</em>, in print, 2022.</li>\n<li>“Empirical Likelihood Inference for Longitudinal Data with Covariate Measurement Errors: An Application to the LEAN Study,” with Guoyou Qin, Zhongyi Zhu and Jiajia Zhang, <em>Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis</em>, Vol. 175, 2022, pp. 107553.</li>\n<li>“Estimation of Local Treatment Effects Under the Binary Instrumental Variable Model,” with Linbo Wang, Thomas Richardson and James Robins,<em> Biometrika</em>, Vol. 108, No. 4, 2021, pp. 881-894.</li>\n<li>“A Novel Robust Approach for Analysis of Longitudinal Data,” with Guoyou Qin, Zhongyi Zhu and Wanghong Xu. <em>Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis</em>, Vol. 138, 2019, pp. 83-95.</li>\n<li>“Robust Estimation in Linear Regression Models for Longitudinal Data with Covariate Measurement Errors and Outliers,” with Guoyou Qin, Zhongyi Zhu and Jiajia Zhang, <em>Journal of Multivariate Analysis</em>, Vol. 168, 2018, pp. 261-275.</li>\n</ul>\n","department":["management science and statistics"],"roles":["faculty"]},"25747":{"first_name":"Tianhai","last_name":"Zu","faculty_title":"Assistant Professor of Management Science and Statistics ","faculty_email":"tianhai.zu@utsa.edu","faculty_phone":"","faculty_fax":"","faculty_office_number":"BB 4.03.44","faculty_pdf":"","faculty_additional_info":"","department_role_repeater":[{"department":"Management Science and Statistics","role":"Faculty"}],"uri":"tianhai-zu","fullname":"Tianhai Zu","id":25747,"status":"publish","link":"https://business.utsa.edu/faculty/tianhai-zu/","json":"https://business.utsa.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/faculty/25747","media":[{"id":25811,"alt":"Tianhai Zu","path":"uploads/2023/08/Zu_Tianhai_5444-e1692900916971.jpg","correctedPath":"faculty/headshots/management-science-and-statistics/25747-tianhai-zu.jpg"}],"topd":"Management Science and Statistics","dslug":"management-science-and-statistics","content":"","department":["management science and statistics"],"roles":["faculty"]},"25748":{"first_name":"Dengdeng","last_name":"Yu","faculty_title":"Assistant Professor of Management Science and Statistics","faculty_email":"dengdeng.yu@utsa.edu","faculty_phone":"","faculty_fax":"","faculty_office_number":"BB 04.04.04","faculty_pdf":"","faculty_additional_info":"","department_role_repeater":[{"department":"Management Science and Statistics","role":"Faculty"}],"uri":"dengdeng-yu","fullname":"Dengdeng Yu","id":25748,"status":"publish","link":"https://business.utsa.edu/faculty/dengdeng-yu/","json":"https://business.utsa.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/faculty/25748","media":[{"id":25813,"alt":"Dengdeng Yu","path":"uploads/2023/08/Yu_Dengdeng_5406-e1692900880223.jpg","correctedPath":"faculty/headshots/management-science-and-statistics/25748-dengdeng-yu.jpg"}],"topd":"Management Science and Statistics","dslug":"management-science-and-statistics","content":"","department":["management science and statistics"],"roles":["faculty"]},"25929":{"first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Castellanos","faculty_title":"Doctoral Student -
