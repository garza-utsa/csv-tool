He was a reliability engineer at Bell Helicopter Textron (1973-1979) and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He served as chair of the Departments of Management Science and Statistics (2001-2004) and Demography (2007-2009). He served as interim director of the Divisions of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (1986-1988) and Management, Marketing and Management Science (1999-2000). He served as associate dean of the College of Sciences and Engineering on three separate occasions including the first two years of the university&#8217;s Downtown Campus operations. He joined UTSA in 1981 and the Carlos Alvarez College of Business in 2001.</p>\n<p>His primary area of research compares estimators under various criteria including Pitman nearness or closeness. He has many refereed publications in scholarly journals on this subject including a monograph published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 1993. He also publishes in areas of statistical inference on topics such as environmental science and reliability theory. He applies his work as a consultant in many different areas including: a reliability analysis of NASA satellites used in its Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (through Southwest Research Institute); a patent to detect leaks in underground storage tanks (Valero); and a system to determine the reliability of subsea fiber optic cables to control oil pumping stations on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Mexico (Mobil Research and Development through Southwest Research Institute).</p>\n<p>He has received numerous honors for teaching including the President&#8217;s Distinguished Achievement Award for Teaching Excellence in 1989 and 2001; and the Chancellor&#8217;s Council Teaching Award for excellence in teaching undergraduates (from the UT System&#8217;s Chancellor&#8217;s Council) in 1995 and 2001. He teaches in the undergraduate and graduate programs in statistics and the Ph.D. program in the Carlos Alvarez College of Business. He has co-advised two dissertations and served on numerous dissertation committees.</p>\n<p>He was elected to the honorific rank of fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1997. He was named a Peter T. Flawn Professor of Statistics in 2002 at UTSA. He served as editor of <em>STATS</em> (1999-2001) and served on the editorial review board of <em>Communications in Statistics</em> as an associate editor from 1995-2012. He received the Don B. Owen Award in Statistics in 2006 given to a statistician for excellence in research, consulting and editorial service.</p>\n<p>Keating has more than 50 refereed journal publications, two books, three book chapters, four encyclopedia articles and numerous other publications.

He joined the UTSA faculty in 2003 and retired in 2019. Prior to his current position, Dr. Ko was a professor and the graduate program director at the Department of Biostatistics at the Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University (1985-2003). He is also an adjunct professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio and a professor at the UTSA Neurosciences Institute.</p>\n<p>Professor Ko&#8217;s research focuses on the use of stochastic modeling and/or machine learning methods in scientific applications in bioinformatics, neuroscience, geophysics (reconstruction of the past position of tectonic plates) and information science (information retrieval and security risk identification). Professor Ko&#8217;s current research projects includes 1) characterization and modeling groups of neural spike trains and multiple group comparison of point processes; 2) identification of information security risks involving organizational information security management using data mining tools; 3) development of new statistical learning tools to improve their performances and retrieval effectiveness by combining supervised and/or unsupervised learning tools; 4) robust directional data analysis; and 5) methods development for microarray and proteomics data analysis.</p>\n<p>Professor Ko teaches in the areas of bioinformatics (microarray and proteomics data analysis), advanced statistical learning/ data mining, advanced survival analysis (counting process approach), survival analysis, categorical data, and advanced theory of statistical inference.</p>\n<h3><strong>Selected Publications</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“Phasic Dopamine Transmission Reflects Initiation Vigor and Exerted Effort in an Action- and Region-specific Manner,” (with M.J.

Kotz, 3rd edition, 2005, John Wiley and Sons.</p>\n<p>He was a visiting Research Scientist at Brooks Air Force Base during 1985-1987 and 1993-1995 under a grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). He also had frequent summer grants with the AFOSR. During these visits, he collaborated with the investigators of the Air Force Health Study which investigated the adverse health effects of dioxin on U.S. Air Force Vietnam veterans. Under this project, he developed methodology for analyzing data on exposure of humans to contaminants, especially to dioxin. These results appear in a series of articles in <em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health</em>, <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em>, <em>Environmetrics</em>, <em>Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, <em>Statistics in Medicine</em> and <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em>. He has also worked in the area of survival analysis with censored observations. This work has appeared in the <em>Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference</em> and the <em>Journal of Nonparametric Statistics</em>.</p>\n<p>He has published about 50 research articles in major statistical journals. He has contributed four articles by invitation on special topics on count data in the <em>Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences</em>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Models for count data</li>\n<li>Biostatistics</li>\n<li>Inflated models</li>\n<li>Statistical inference</li>\n<li>Survival analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Selected Publications</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“A General Family of Discrete Distributions with Hypergeometric Probabilities,” with John Gurland, <em>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,</em> B , Vol. 39<strong>,</strong> 1977, pp. 349-356.</li>\n<li>“The Effect of Errors in Diagnosis and Errors in Measurement on the Estimation of the Probability of an Event,” with Joel Michalek, <em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em>, Vol. 75, 1980, pp. 713-721.</li>\n<li>“A Method of Increasing Power of a Test for the Negative Binomial and Neyman Type A Distributions,” with Narayan Bhalerao and John Gurland, <em>Journal of the American Statistical Association,</em> Vol. 75, 1980, pp. 934-938.</li>\n<li>“Statistical Inference Regarding the Generalized Poisson Distribution,”<strong> </strong>with<strong> </strong>Ramesh Gupta, <em>Sankhya, Series B,</em><strong> </strong>Vol. 46, 1984, pp. 166-173.</li>\n<li>“Cautions on the Reanalysis of Epidemiologic Databases,” with Joel Michalek and Dan Mihalko, <em>Statistics in Medicine</em>, Vol. 8, 1989, pp. 653-664.</li>\n<li>“Statistical Tests Involving Several Independent Gamma Distributions,” with Ramesh Gupta and Robert K.

In particular, his research endeavors are focused on improving access to essential health commodities (e.g., contraceptives, antimalarials, HIV medication) in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs). For individuals who are deprived of access to such essential health commodities, the consequences can be dire. For example, without reliable access to contraceptives, women may suffer unintended pregnancies, imposing economic and psychological burden, and adverse health outcomes including injuries, infections, and even deaths. HIV patients unable to obtain antiretrovirals may face delays in treatment initiation and interruptions during the treatment process, subsequently increasing the risk of viral resistance, treatment failure, and mortality.</p>\n<p>Focusing on this context, Karimi&#8217;s research aims to:<br />\n(i) Empirically evaluate and uncover the factors that contribute to health commodity stock-outs in developing countries by leveraging field data and using a combination of rigorous econometric and predictive modeling techniques;<br />\n(ii) Generate actionable insights that public health organizations, governments, and donors can use to mitigate the risk of stock-outs in developing countries.</p>\n<h3><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Health</li>\n<li>Healthcare Supply Chains</li>\n<li>Socially Responsible Supply Chains</li>\n<li>Empirical Analysis</li>\n<li>Advanced Econometrics</li>\n<li>Predictive Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
