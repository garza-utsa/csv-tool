During his tenure at NHCNE, he deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Early in the deployment, he played an instrumental role in the formation and leadership of Medical Task Force Kuwait, a joint Army-Navy medical command with a presence in Kuwait, Qatar, and Djibouti.</p>\n<p>Upon completion of this deployment, Towers finished his tour at NHCNE and accepted orders to serve as the operations officer for 1st Dental Battalion (1st Marine Logistics Group), Camp Pendleton, California. In this capacity, he earned designation as a Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officer and assisted in the training and qualification of many other Naval officers within 1<span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px;\">st</span> Marine Logistics Group.

Since 2014, he has served as a volunteer instructor with the Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO), completing two separate missions to Pristina, Kosovo in 2015 and 2017, and leading a mission to Maputo, Mozambique in 2019. He began serving as course director for the in-residence Executive Healthcare Resource Management Course in 2019. In addition to his activities with DIMO, Towers was competitively selected for the prestigious Fulbright Specialist Program in June 2017.
