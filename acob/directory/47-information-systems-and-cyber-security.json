Endowed Professorship at UTSA. Earlier in his career, Raymond worked for the Singapore Police Force, the Australian Government’s Australian Institute of Criminology, and the University of South Australia. He was also a visiting scholar at Australian National University’s School of Regulation and Global Governance, a visiting expert at INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in 2015, a visiting Fulbright scholar at Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice and at Palo Alto Research Center in 2009, and an Honorary Commander, 502nd Air Base Wing, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, from 2017 to 2019.</p>\n<p>He is the founding co-Editor-in-Chief of <em>ACM Distributed Ledger Technologies: Research &amp; Practice</em>, and founding Chair of IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society (TEMS)’s Technical Committee on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies. He currently serves as an Advisory Council Member of the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (a 501(c)3 US-based nonprofit, aims to disrupt the market of human trafficking, child exploitation, and child sexual abuse material), and is an Adjunct Professor (Courtesy Appointment) at the University of South Australia and Singapore University of Technology and Design.</p>\n<p>He is an ACM Distinguished Speaker and IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitor (2021 – 2023). In 2015 he and his team won the Digital Forensics Research Challenge organized by Germany’s University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. He is the recipient of the 2022 IEEE Hyper-Intelligence TC Award for Excellence in Hyper-Intelligence Systems (Technical Achievement award), the 2022 IEEE TC on Homeland Security Research and Innovation Award, the 2022 IEEE TC on Secure and Dependable Measurement Mid-Career Award, and the 2019 IEEE TC on Scalable Computing Award for Excellence in Scalable Computing (Middle Career Researcher). He has also received best paper awards from IEEE Systems Journal in 2021, IEEE Computer Society’s Bio-Inspired Computing Special Technical Committee Outstanding Paper Award for 2021, IEEE DSC 2021, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine for 2020, Journal of Network and Computer Applications for 2020, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking in 2019, IEEE TrustCom 2018, and ESORICS 2015, and Best Student Paper Awards from Inscrypt 2019 and ACISP 2005.</p>\n<p>He also has two granted regular U.S. patent applications on lightweight cryptographic scheme for mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Interests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big data analytics, including privacy-preserving analytics</li>\n<li>Blockchain and distributed ledger technology</li>\n<li>Cyber security</li>\n<li>Digital forensics, including forensics-by-design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>His research has been funded by funding agencies in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S.: NASA, National Security Agency, National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, CPS Energy, LGS Innovations, MITRE, Texas National Security Network Excellence Fund; and</li>\n<li>Australia: National Health and Medical Research Council, Australian Government National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund, Australian Government Cooperative Research Centre for Data to Decision, Lockheed Martin Australia, auDA Foundation, Government of South Australia, BAE Systems stratsec, Australasian Institute of Judicial Administration Incorporated, Australian Research Council</li>\n</ul>\n<p>His research has been widely cited, including in government reports of the Australian Government, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), U.S. CRS Report for Congress (Prepared for Members and Committees of Congress), International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and UK Home Office. One of his published cryptographic protocols was included in two independent submissions to the IEEE 802.11, the working group setting the standards for wireless LANs, by computer scientists from Fujitsu Labs in America; and the IETF / Network Working Group by a team of computer scientists from Tropos Networks (U.S.), Toshiba, Huawei, and University of Murcia. Another of his published protocol was used in the P2P solution of the Milagro TLS (pairing-based cryptography for Transport Layer Security) presented to the IETF by researchers from MIRACL Ltd in 2016. His published design principle about how session keys should be constructed in cryptographic (key establishment) protocols that result in significant benefits for their security was cited in a special publication (SP 800-56A) – Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography – by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as the subsequent versions (Revision 2, 2013, and Revision 3, April 2018).</p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":6392,"template":"","faculty_departments":[44,47],"acf":{"first_name":"Kim-Kwang
