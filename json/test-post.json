The award recognizes graduate students and post-doctoral fellows for their chemical science research across a range of areas, including computational, analytical, medicinal, biological and synthetic chemistry.   </p>   <p>    To apply for the award, Kaitlyn submitted a research summary, CV, personal statement, and recommendation letter from    <b>     Francis Yoshimoto    </b>    , her research advisor and assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry.   </p>   <p>    Kaitlyn will be paired with several mentors at Merck, attend an award symposium in Rahway, NJ in September, and also have access to a series of professional seminars and workshops.   </p>   <p>    &quot;I am so excited for the opportunity to network with scientists in an industrial setting and see what industry is like before I graduate in spring 2024,&quot; said Kaitlyn.   </p>   <p>    Kaitlyn was also selected to attend the    <a href=\"https://corporate.dow.com/en-us/careers/work-at-dow/best-symposium.html\" target=\"_blank\">     DOW BEST (Building Engineering &amp; Science Talent) Symposium    </a>    , which will be held from July 24-27 in Midland, MI where she'll have the opportunity to visit and present her research at both Merck and DOW's company sites.   </p>   <p>    Kaitlyn started at UTSA as a freshman in the UT CAP program but decided to remain a Roadrunner after her first semester. In spring 2020, she graduated from both the College of Sciences and the Honors College with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry.   </p>   <p>    After completing her undergrad, Kaitlyn decided to continue her education and pursue a Ph.D. in Chemistry at the    <a href=\"https://explore.utsa.edu/graduate/\" target=\"_blank\">     UTSA Graduate School    </a>    because she enjoyed the research opportunities available in the program. Kaitlyn's research experience includes studying the chemistry and biology of bioactive natural products from the medicinal plant,    <i>     Artemisia annua    </i>    . She is a Ford Foundation Pre-doctoral Fellow, and an NSF GRFP fellow.   </p>   <p class=\"byline\" align=\"right\">    &#8211; Ryan Schoensee    <br />    June 2, 2023   </p>  </div>  <!-- end column 2 --> </div> <!-- end row --> <!-- back to top --> <p>  &#160; </p></div>"
