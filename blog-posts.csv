13515,UTSA adds Master of Science in Biomedical Technology Commercialization,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>(Aug. 29, 2019) -- The College of Engineering and College of Business at UTSA are collaborating to offer a joint Master of Science degree program in Biomedical Technology Commercialization, beginning in the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>â€œWith advances in biomedical technologies and the need to have diverse and interdisciplinary knowledge for commercialization of developed technologies and devices, this program is highly attractive to students who have an undergraduate degree in engineering, sciences, or business,â€ says <strong>Anson Ong</strong>, associate dean of Administration and Graduate Studies for the UTSA College of Engineering.</p>
<p>Approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board on July 25, 2019, and administered in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering, the program is designed to provide students with a common platform of understanding in the areas of bioengineering and management of technology by taking nine semester credit hours of core courses from each college.</p>
<p>Students will subsequently be able to enhance their learning through an additional nine semester hours of elective courses from either college and finally by completing a final project in the area of biomedical technologies and commercialization.</p>
<p>â€œContemporary biomedical firms need employees who are able to help them bridge the gap between product development and success in the market place,â€ says <strong>Kevin Grant</strong>, associate dean of Undergraduate Studies for the UTSA College of Business. â€œThe new Master of Science in Biomedical Technology Commercialization will provide students with the skills they need to contribute to the success of these contemporary firms.â€Â Â </p>
<p>At the completion of the degree program, students will have ample knowledge in the design of biomedical devices, technology commercialization, product development, intellectual properties, and the business knowledge to market those devices.</p>

15267,2018 Rising Star Award in Urban and Regional Planning: Levar Martin,"<em>The UTSA CACPâ€™s Rising Star Distinguished Alumni are those who are demonstrating bright promise in the first decade of their professional lives. They show evidence of outstanding professional progression, such as licensure in architecture or position increase over time in any field, and evidence of service to their communities or professions. A native of San Antonio, Texas, Levar earned his Master of Science in Urban and Regional Planning degree from UTSA in 2014. He is currently National Director of Programs for the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB), a position he began in January 2017. He began with NALCAB in 2011 as a Program Assistant â€” at the same time he began his masterâ€™s degree at UTSA â€” and has held several positions culminating in his current one. At NALCAB, he oversees the Equitable Neighborhood Development Program. Levar has continually worked to advance economic mobility for low- and moderate-income persons and was recently accepted into the NeighborWorks America, Achieving Excellence Executive Leadership program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</em>

<strong>On his time spent at UTSA:</strong>

After completing my undergraduate degree in Sociology, with a concentration in Urban Studies, from Trinity University, I wanted to pursue a degree in urban planning. The semester after I graduated from Trinity, UTSA launched the Masters in Urban and Regional Planning program and I wanted to learn in a program that was connected to my home town. What stands out to me was the connection that the city had to practitioners to learn from those in the planning profession along with the expertise of the UTSA professors.

<strong>On working with NALCAB for the last seven years:</strong>

My experience has been challenging and rewarding. We support real estate development, small business investment and financial capability programming through more than 120 local nonprofits in 40 states and Washington, DC. We also provide funding to organizations to develop Equitable Neighborhood Development Plans to respond to changes they are experiencing in their communities. It is challenging in that many of the communities we serve have been historically capital neglected and continue to face poverty and a lack of wealth-building opportunities. It is rewarding as our work supports low- to - moderate income communities in building economic assets and wealth.

<strong>His typical workday:</strong>

My day consists of guiding the implementation of our organizationâ€™s asset building strategies, usually quite a few meetings, and communicating with funders, government agencies, and municipalities around economic development, affordable housing, financial capability and small-business investment programs, contracts, and initiatives.

<strong>On NALCABâ€™s Equitable Neighborhood Development Program and the different roles he has held, such as Senior Program Manager and Program Director:</strong>

Our Equitable Neighborhood Development program area came from responding to the needs of the communities we serve. Many of our member organizations across the U.S. were telling us their neighborhoods were changing significantly and they did not quite understand why or how to respond to those changes. Lots of research exists around reacting to or responding to neighborhood change, including gentrification and displacement after it has already occurred, but there is limited research on how to get ahead of the changes so that existing residents and businesses can also benefit from the economic development and investment that is coming into these historically capital neglected communities. This led us to deeply engage in analyzing and anticipating neighborhood change, including displacement and gentrification. As Senior Program Manager and then Program Director of Equitable Neighborhood Development, I had the opportunity to lead the design and implementation of our programmatic approach and methodology of understanding and getting ahead of neighborhood change across multiple U.S. cities. This includes, but is not limited to, data analysis, GIS mapping, community engagement and facilitation, developing training curriculum, conducting multiple site visits, and advancing fair housing policy and advocacy.

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>

Dive into the work, make yourself uncomfortable and meet as many people in the field as possible. Attend symposiums, conferences, and events. Ask people to lunch or coffee to get to know what they do and to understand what type of work is out there. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help and do something you enjoy.

An Austin, Texas native who currently resides in Spring Branch, Nikki Gledhill earned her Bachelor of Science in Interior Design from UTSA in 2006. She is currently CEO and VIP Aircraft Interior Designer at MBG International Design, LLC, which was established in 2009. She has contributed to the interior design of jets for MGM Resorts, Sands Group, Google, United Arab Emiratesâ€™ President, the Japanese government, and confidential Chinese and Saudi Arabian clients. Nikki was named the 2017 Designer to Watch from Jet Moda Magazine and earned Top 10 designs of the decade 2007-2017 from Business Jet Interiors in the Airbus 340-500 category. She was shorted listed for Pegasus by the International Yacht and Aviation Awards in 2013.</em>

<strong>On</strong><strong>Â her time spent at UTSA:</strong>

My time at UTSA started at the 1604 campus with my freshman and sophomore studio classes. The beginning of Junior year was when the College of Architecture was moved to the downtown campus. I graduated in 2006. I remember long nights and professors that genuinely cared about our well being and our success, even after graduation.

<strong>How she got into aircraft interior design:</strong>

Immediately following my gradation in 2006, I was hired by an aircraft design and modification company in San Antonio. I worked on numerous different aircrafts frames from Boeing and Airbus until 2011, when I left to pursue MBG full time where I continued working with Airbus and Boeing along with smaller aircraft such as Gulfstream, Citation, Embraer, and Bombardier.

<strong>On working with MBG International Design, LLC:</strong>

Every project is unique and one-of-a-kind. Each client is distinctive and desires something special and more enhanced than the next person. Custom, highly detailed, and state-of-the-art are always the understood reality for every project.

<strong>Her typical workday:</strong>

Many days start before the sun even rises. Checking email that has been delivered while I slept. The majority of my clients are overseas and their days are different and almost over once I wake in the morning. A lot of work and correspondence happens overnight. Therefore, many mornings are for playing catch up. After conquering emails, I generally start my task list for the day. Which can include, sketching, working on material specifications, selecting materials, redlining elevation packages or marking up 3D renderings.

<strong>Her advice for current students:</strong>

Soak it all in. The knowledge, the all-nighters, the friendships, itâ€™s all part of the process. It may seem overwhelming, the days and nights in your design studios, but that never changes. Itâ€™s setting you up for the years in your career where you will do the same. Chase after the dream, not the money. Youâ€™ll find your most comfortable and rewarding job may not be the highest-paying one.

The Shangri La Nature Center has won five awards and has been published four times. The ASU Health Services building has won six awards and has been published twice. Joseph has also won awards personally and has been published locally, in Texas, and nationally. He is a member of AIA San Antonio and has begun serving on advisory councils for the college.</em><strong>On his time spent at UTSA:</strong>

My fondest memories of my time at UTSA were my architecture studio classes with Gevork Hartoonian, Dwayne Bohuslav, and the Lake Flato Studio.

<strong>On working with Lake Flato for 20 years:</strong>

My time at Lake Flato has been amazing! Itâ€™s still weird to think itâ€™s been 20 years because itÂ seems it was just a short time ago that I started working here. The work that I get to be part of is incredible, but itâ€™s really the people and the family at Lake Flato that I find most special. I work with talented people daily.

<strong>His typical workday:</strong>

It doesnâ€™t look like I thought it would when I was in architecture school. My typical day is usually filled with answering and sending emails, phone calls, lots of meetings, and some travel interspersed. Actual drawing time is limited in comparison to what I envisioned while I was in school, but it is still incredibly rewarding because the emails, phone calls, and travel are an essential part of making our projects and office successful.

<strong>On recent or notable projects:</strong>

The Shangri La Botanical Garden and Nature Center in Orange, Texas is the first LEED Platinum project on the Gulf Coast. The Sunshine Cottage School in San Antonio is for hearing impaired kids, but what makes it interesting is thatÂ itâ€™s an auditory learning school. Background noise needed to be minimized and mechanical and electrical systems required special attention. The new San Antonio Federal Courthouse is an important public project, as it will replace the existing Woods courthouse. I feel honored to have a hand in a project that is so important to the city and region.

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>

Plans change, be adaptable. Opportunities are all around us and you shouldnâ€™t be so focused on your plans that you miss opportunities that might not be part of the original plan. My originalÂ plan was to leave San Antonio, andÂ possibly Texas after graduation, but the opportunity at Lake Flato came up. Even then I thought Iâ€™d get a little experience with a greatÂ firm, then move on, but 20 years later Iâ€™m still here and wouldnâ€™t change a thing.

15277,Ground to air: San Antonio's prosperity depends on expanded mobility,"<div>

<em>By W. Scott Bailey, Senior Reporter, San Antonio Business Journal</em>

(September 28, 2018) -- San Antonio, one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities based on population, is at a crossroads where its leaders are faced with addressing transportation challenges on the ground and in the air â€”Â or risk eventual economic gridlock.

Gaining consensus on how to proceed could prove challenging, however, as there are signs of disagreement regarding the future of some of the city's chief transportation assets, including San Antonio International Airport.

â€œOur population growth is accelerating because of the opportunities that people find here and the fact that locals donâ€™t want to leave,â€ said San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, who has made transportation one of his top priorities.â€œIn terms of infrastructure investment and development, we are at the proverbial fork in the road.â€

<strong>Developing a ground game</strong>

San Antonio needs a long-term ground strategy to prevent congestion on its roads that could paralyze its economy. Nirenberg has warned that if current growth continues without expanded transit options, local drivers could see commute times increase 75 percent.

San Antonio drivers are spending an average of 20 percent more time stuck in congestion than in times of free-flowing traffic, according to data from travel company TomTom. That's up from a decade ago, when drivers spent 15 percent more time in congestion compared to free-flowing traffic. Those increases in drive times are higher during peak commuting times. From 7 to 9 a.m., local drivers spend about 35 percent more time in traffic. And commuters from 5 to 7 p.m. have it worse, spending 50 percent longer in their vehicles than they would during free-flowing traffic, TomTom data indicates.

<strong>Busy intersections in SA</strong>

In order to determine some of the city's busiest intersections, We chose several busy intersections from the cityâ€™s Traffic Counts Query website, which includes the date measured.

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thousand_Oaks.jpg"" alt="""" />

On average, San Antonio drivers spend more than 100 hours a year in traffic due to congested roads. Those commutes will likely increase with San Antonio's population.

VIA Metropolitan Transit has been developing a Vision 2040 Long-Range Transportation Plan to address such concerns. Itâ€™s identified several priorities, including the need for more frequent and reliable service, as well as a proposed rapid transit network and increased integration of new technology.

â€œIn fiscal 2018, in partnership with the city, we started a ramp up for more frequent service on nine routes within five corridors,â€ VIA President and CEO Jeffrey Arndt said. â€œIn January, we will add four more corridors to the frequent network.â€

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeffrey_Arndt.jpg"" alt="""" />

<em>VIA Metropolitan Transit CEO Jeffrey Arndt said trackless trains are among the options being considered to move more people about the city.
Sergio Chapa | SABJ</em>

The routes affected have seen a 30 percent or greater increase in ridership, according to VIA. Arndt said the enhanced service and increased ridership was made possible by funding from Bexar County for capital improvements, including new buses.

VIA is also working to expand its Primo bus service to Brooks and other key hubs in the city, and itâ€™s partnering with ride-hailing companies such as Lyft Inc.

Port San Antonio CEO Jim Perschbach believes there is an opportunity to transform the 1,900-acre site once home to Kelly Air Force Base into a greater economic hub around multiple industries, including cybersecurity. But he said transportation will be critical.

â€œWe have, in San Antonio, some truly deep capabilities in areas that are going to be increasingly important to the global economy in the years and decades to come,â€ he said. â€œBut we will not be able to take advantage of these capabilities if they cannot connect with each other.â€

Antonio Petrov, an associate professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio who heads the Urban Future Lab, a local think tank and research lab, said the Alamo City should borrow more ideas from cities like Boston, Miami, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles, which have moved to embrace trends in public transportation.

â€œThe way we currently look at transportation in San Antonio is very car-centric,â€ he said. â€œIt not only shows in the growing pains of a city with more traffic and the increase in emissions, but it also becomes a question of the performance of our infrastructural and transportation systems.â€

<strong>Expanding air connectivity</strong>

In 2013, 7.8 million passengers flew into or out of San Antonio International Airport. Last year, the passenger total surpassed 8.6 million. Airport officials said there is a strong potential for the 2018 passenger count to exceed 10 million, which would be a new high mark for the city.

Nirenberg has created the Air Services Development Committee and named Denim Group Principal John Dickson as its chair. That group has undertaken a data-based study to determine whether there is an opportunity to expand San Antonio International Airport or whether a new one should be built elsewhere.

<em>Denim Group Principal John Dickson is heading Mayor Ron Nirenberg's Air Services Development Committee.
Gabe Hernandez | SABJ</em>

â€œWe have followed a fact-driven process throughout to help answer the question about a new airport footprint versus the existing footprint at San Antonio International,â€ Dickson said. â€œWe are close to coming up with a recommendation.â€

In the interim, former Mayor Henry Cisneros insists the Alamo City needs more serious dialogue about a new airport.

â€œIâ€™m not saying we have to build it immediately. But if I had a voice, we would begin to plan,â€ Cisneros said. â€œI donâ€™t think you can get an up-to-date facility in piecemeal fashion.â€

Nirenberg is not ready to look beyond the current facility.

â€œWe all agree on one principle point: San Antonioâ€™s economy needs an internationally competitive airport,"" he said. ""The disagreement has been where that airport should be and if San Antonio International has a future. My hypothesis has always been that it is a strategic competitive advantage for us to have our international airport in the middle of one of the largest cities in the nation. I believe we will begin to prove up that hypothesis with real data.â€

He noted that the city is up about 50 percent in new markets and nonstop flight growth â€” ""an indication our market is demanding more connectivity.â€

<em>San Antonio Aviation Director Russ Handy said San Antonio International Airport has room to expand.
Carlos Javier Sanchez | SABJ</em>

The increased passenger counts at San Antonio International are a result of efforts by San Antonio Aviation Director Russ Handy and Chief Air Services Development Officer Brian Pratte, among others, who continue to recruit more carriers and nonstop service to the city. Frontier Airlines launched 11 new flights from San Antonio in August.

Asked whether San Antonio International can handle more growth or is in danger of becoming landlocked, Handy was generally confident that it has room to grow.

""The short answer is we have significant space to expand in the key areas where we are nearing capacity,"" he said.

At the same time, he said the question is complex, involving more than terminals, and that the city will ""carefully examine what the limits are going forward and how to optimize our real estate.â€

<strong>Moving outside the box</strong>

San Antonio was once more aggressive in its approach to transportation. It introduced some of the first electric street cars well over a century ago. The city was home to two skyrides. And it built a monorail system that moved millions of visitors at HemisFair 50 years ago.

Now, one of the cityâ€™s more unique modes of alternative transportation are electric scooters, seemingly available on every downtown street. But there are more potentially groundbreaking ideas in the works.

Bus rapid transit is one element VIA is exploring as part of a â€œcomprehensive operational analysis,â€ said Arndt, who has cited so-called trackless trains as a variation of such a system to consider in San Antonio. The electric trains could operate autonomously and would not run on rail. Instead, they would follow virtual tracks on dedicated roads.

â€œThe advantage is that we could open it with articulated buses,â€ Arndt said. â€œAnd as the technology of the trackless train improves, we could introduce connected automated vehicle platoons.â€

VIA officials are optimistic that, over the next three to five years, either trackless train technology will prove workable or another high-capacity transit option could be deployed.

â€œWhether itâ€™s trackless trains or more micro transportation, the important thing is we need to have options. And those options need to be on right of way thatâ€™s dedicated separately from automotive traffic,â€ Nirenberg said.

Petrov and his team have proposed other ideas, including a public skybus transit system that would carry riders along Broadway Street from the airport to downtown.

â€œAt stake is more than a ground transportation strategy,â€ he said. â€œThere needs to be a more holistic approach in the way we reimagine existing systems.â€

<strong>On returning to UTSA for his graduate education and pursuing the Graduate Certificate in Historic Preservation:</strong>

While obtaining my undergraduate degree, I served as UTSA AIAS president. This provided a sneak-preview opportunity, as I collaborated with upper graduate students and professors. An easy choice to be made! I personally enjoy restoring historic projects and push others in the profession to get involved. UTSA has a great program that offers many opportunities that allow the students to get their hands dirty and jump right into preservation.

<strong>On working with Jacobs Engineering as a Project Manager:</strong>

Jacobs has more opportunities than I ever imagined. We have been challenged to elevate the architecture group as a top design firm, and weâ€™re growing fast. Not to mention, we are hiring! Co-workers and mentors really helped throughout the licensing process. Itâ€™s not easy. Over time, I gained experience in multi-discipline management of ground-up projects ranging in size from $1 million to $4 billon in construction cost, including one of the world's largest data center campuses. My responsibilities embrace development and management of projects through all phases of design, production, and construction. This includes fast-track scheduling, executing proposals, and collaborating with clients and achieving strategic business goals.

<strong>On recent or notable projects:</strong>

Since graduating UTSA, I have practiced a wide variety of project types including critical facilities for the Fortune Top 10, higher education, financial institutions, retail, corporate, historic restoration, and marketing design strategies. Iâ€™m currently managing a handful of projects for Purdue University, including a new STEM Teaching Lab Building that will provide 118,000 square feet of laboratory space for the College of Science.

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>

Market yourself and lock down an internship. When you land that first job, start volunteering for work outside your day-to-day task. Become a sponge and soak it all in! And most of allâ€¦ try to have a little fun doing it! Laughter and a great personally goes a very long way.

Charles has participated in the San Antonio Professional Practice Leadership Program, speaks to junior high and high school students about the architectural profession, and has represented Overland at university career fairs.</em>

<strong>On his time spent at UTSA:</strong>

UTSA was attractive for a very practical reason.Â I graduated Texas A&amp;M in December as opposed to the typical spring and UTSA was willing to enroll me the following semester. I was able to work with Dr. Tangum for a period of time, I interned at Overland for a year and a half, and even taught a Design IV studio my last semester while completing my thesis.

The second reason I chose UTSA was that I already had some classmates from the year ahead of me going to school here.Â I also had inside information from one of them that Overland was going to be teaching a studio my first semester.Â Having been at TAMU while the Bonfire Memorial was designed and built, I really admired their work and wanted to learn from practicing architects, something not available in College Station.

Michael Rey taught that first studio and has become a great friend and mentor over the years.Â He also taught the studio I took the following semester.Â I enjoyed my time at TAMU, but consider the Overland studio my first true â€œdesignâ€ studio, where I wasnâ€™t relying purely on my intuition and form-making talents, but thinking critically about the concept, the diagram, the design and how that impacted the details.Â I think it was a key formative experience in my professional development.

<strong>On working with Overland Partners for 11 years:</strong>

Iâ€™ve truly got an experience of Overland not many get to have: Iâ€™ve had a chance to grow within the firm from an intern position, cut my teeth as a designer/technician on some really great work with really great people, earn my license and run my own project not long after doing so, lead multiple projects and multiple people, and now lead thought and design thinking across the office.

<strong>On recent or notable projects:</strong>

My keystone project was a small church I worked on here in town called the Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit.Â This project is interesting on many levels.Â It was my first project to work on, lead and manage as a licensed architect, I was specifically requested to work on it by a building committee member who happened to be the father of one of my classmates, I was the only one on the project so I was responsible for everything, and to top it off, I volunteered to fabricate the door handles for the main door that we designed.

I also got to work on the Liberal Arts building at UT which was the opposite end of the spectrum. The building was so huge we broke it up into pieces for each member of the team to manage.Â At one point we had 15 people around the table during a team briefing.Â I learned the importance of designing with rules and conviction while collaborating with a lot of people.Â It taught me that we canâ€™t do everything ourselves all the time and that you have to rely on others and communicate really well to be successful.

Most recently Iâ€™ve worked on a couple of high-end residences as well as a pair of visitor centers for two separate botanic gardens.Â I think what is most interesting about these is learning the difference between working with different types of clients, very different ideas of â€œbudgetsâ€ and very different types of delivery and construction processes. It really keeps you on your toes.

<strong>On the Overland Workshop:</strong>

The Overland Workshop is the physical embodiment of the aspirations of several people in our office that value the art of craft.Â It is literally where â€œideas are madeâ€.Â It began with a couple of us who had strong backgrounds in fabrication (specifically steel fabrication) and the thought that we could build it to become an integral part of our design process or even design offerings.Â The â€œWorkshopâ€ was where several of the large, costly design items for our new office were fabricated when the contractor was going to charge more than we wanted to pay.Â It allowed us to explore and create things we wanted to have and do so in an affordable manner because we understood the design well enough to fabricate them economically.Â In the following years, the Workshop participated in a few â€œTreehouseâ€ designs for the San Antonio Botanical Garden, the most recognizable of the designs being â€œthe Gourd.â€

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>
<ol>
 <li>Read. Expose yourself to as many different architects and their work as possible â€“ both contemporary and historic.Â Read about history, art, psychology and philosophy â€“ they will come in more handy than you think.</li>
 <li>Travel.Â Learn from other people and other cultures. See different things.Â Itâ€™s just like reading, only more costly.</li>
 <li>Get involved now.Â Donâ€™t want until you graduate, or until you are licensed, or until you have a family.Â There are opportunities to participate and share your voice all around our city.Â You have been given an education that allows you to see the world differently than most people, solve complex problems more creatively, and care about one another and our environment more passionately.Â Use it.</li>
 <li>Expand your toolbox as much as possible.Â Firms like people who can work across multiple platforms and can communicate their ideas effectively as such.Â This includes sketching, painting, and building with your hands.</li>
 <li>Put in the work.Â The more effort you put in, the more you will get out of it.</li>
 <li>Fail well and learn quickly.</li>
 <li>Practice writing, presenting and sharing your thoughts.Â Communicating your ideas is key to success.</li>
 <li>Speak up.Â I was once told I was hired to think, not draft.Â If you are not sharing your thoughts and ideas â€“ regardless if they are good, bad, chosen or not â€“ you are not doing your job.</li>
 <li>Learn to work with others really well.Â Our profession is all about collaboration: within teams, within the firm, with consultants, contractors, and owners.</li>
 <li>Donâ€™t be afraid to admit you donâ€™t know something.Â We are asked to know a lot about a lot.Â Itâ€™s ok not to know everything.Â Just be honest.</li>
 <li>Donâ€™t take it personally (most of the time). When you encounter friction between differences in opinion, everyone is attacking the idea not the person.Â Friction is a good thing and often leads to the most creative solutions.Â If you do all of the above, you will be able to have a more thoughtful, productive and rewarding conversation with the other person.</li>

15258,2018 Rising Star Award in Interior Design: Micaela Silva,"<em>The UTSA CACPâ€™s Rising Star Distinguished Alumni are those who are demonstrating bright promise in the first decade of their professional lives. They show evidence of outstanding professional progression, such as licensure or position increase over time in any field, and evidence of service to their communities or professions. Originally from Lima, Peru, Micaela Silva earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Interior Design from UTSA in 2011. She is a Designer with Tom Dixon Research Studio in London, where she worked first as an intern, beginning in 2011. She joined the firm as Designer in 2012. Her significant projects are Mondrian Sea Containers Hotel, Eclectic Restaurant in Paris, Greenwich Peninsula, Craft London, Publicis Drugstore Brasserie on Champs Elysees in Paris, and Bronte in Trafalgar Square, London. Craft London, a cafÃ©, restaurantÂ </em><em>and</em><em>Â bar project, was namedÂ </em><em>winner</em><em>Â of â€œBest London Barâ€ at the 2016 Restaurant and Bar Design Awards. Le Drugstore was part of Surface Magazine's 15 ""Best Restaurant &amp; Bar Designs of 2017"" and Bronte was nominated for the ""Best Interior"" award at the 2017 GQ Food &amp; Drink Awards.</em>

<strong>On choosing UTSA:</strong>

Interior design college degrees were not commonplace back in Lima, so I knew I would have to go to university abroad to pursue it. I applied to UTSA because it had the combination of a good, accredited interior design programme, a womenâ€™s tennis team and an interesting location. I was lucky enough to be offered a full scholarship to play on the team so I started school in the fall of 2008.

<strong>On her path to London and Tom Dixonâ€™s Design Research Studio, where she has worked for the last seven years:</strong>

I met my now wife at UTSA and sheâ€™s from the United Kingdom. We planned to move to London together after graduation as it was the perfect place for both of our careers. Itâ€™s hard to think of a better place to work in design. My experience [with Tom Dixon] has been extremely positive. I learned so much even in just my few months as an intern. Having not been able to do an internship during my time in college due to the tennis team requirements, I had a lot to catch up on! The studio is a great place to work, Tom and the team are incredibly creative and just a great group of people. Being exposed and involved with the product design and development side of the business has also been a very valuable experience.

<strong>On project work at different stages:</strong>

Typically our phases of work are split into Concept, Design Development, Detailed Design, Construction and Styling with of course some variation depending on the scale and type of project. The concept stage is where the big ideas and overall approach are presented, mostly as reference images with some high-level sketches and visuals as well as initial layouts. For me Design Development is one of the more exciting parts as the client is already on board with the concept and you really focus on translating it into reality and working through all the challenges that inevitably come up. In Detailed Design the focus is on drawing and document output, so this is always a very time-consuming stage and time management is key. At the same time this is the stage where we start developing the custom items â€” furniture and lighting as well as larger feature joinery items like bars or reception desks. During the construction stage itâ€™s all about problem solving and dealing with external consultants and contractor queries. Finally, we like to be involved with the styling of a space to really see the design through to the last detail.

<strong>On recent or notable projects:</strong>

Craft London was a really interesting project for many reasons. The site was quite unusual in that it is located in a very new neighbourhood part of a large 20-year residential development. The building itself has a very particular architecture, with oval floor plates, fully glazed faade and a tubular feature ceiling in the main floor. Additionally, the project itself was actually three projects in one, with a cafÃ© on the ground floor, restaurant on the first and bar on the top floor. So the whole thing was a real challenge. Luckily we had worked with the client and developer before and the operator of all three spaces is a chef that has a very close relationship with Tom, so we were given a lot of liberties and trust which is obviously a great way to work.

Le Drugstore was a great project to be involved with because of the history of the company and site. It is owned by the Publicis Group which is the second largest advertising agency in the world and located in their French headquarters,Â on the Champs Elysees in Paris with views to theÂ Arc de Triomphe.Â The concept was inspired by the â€œGolden Era of Advertisingâ€ in the 50s and 60s, and the whole â€œMad Menâ€ aesthetic. So there was a lot of material to draw from and inform the design of this iconic site.

<strong>Her advice for current students:</strong>

My main advice for current students would be to really try to get any working experience you possibly can as early as you can. I know this is not always easy but there is just so much you can only learn from working within a real studio or firm.

Also to use your time in school to learn as many 3D programs while you have access to a variety of technology and people who know how to use it. What software each studio uses is always changing so itâ€™s less about trying to be an expert in everything and more about learningÂ howÂ toÂ learnÂ new software quickly and on the job.

Finally I think if I could go back, I would use my time in school to take more risks with design concepts. While you always have to maintain an element of realism, you have your whole professional career to compromise to client briefs and all sorts of constraints, use this time to train your creativity instead.

15261,2018 Rising Star Award in Construction Science: Derek Sparling,"<em>The UTSA CACPâ€™s Rising Star Distinguished Alumni are those who are demonstrating bright promise in the first decade of their professional lives. They show evidence of outstanding professional progression, such as licensure or position increase over time in any field, and evidence of service to their communities or professions. Originally from San Antonio, Derek Sparling earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Construction Science from UTSA in 2011, after serving in the United States Marine Corp. He is a Senior Project Engineer at Skanska USA Building, where he has worked since 2012. He held a previous position with Zachry Construction.

He earned Skanskaâ€™s Texas Diversity and Inclusions Project Award, also for Methodist Hospital. Derek has attended all of the UTSA Construction Science Career Fairs as a recruiter. He is an Athletic Fund donor, a football season ticket holder, and a pledge donor to the college â€“ for life.</em>

<strong>On his time spent at UTSA:</strong>

I was Honorably Discharged from the Marine Corps in 2007 and all I could think about was getting back to San Antonio, my home. I am a second generation Marine and Roadrunner (Father) and have several family members that have attended UTSA. Construction Science was new at the time and felt like a natural fit for my skillset and experience from the Marine Corps. There are a handful of people that stand out to me the most from UTSA. General Patin, for teaching me to know something because it is right and not because it is in a book and to always be prepared. Dr. K for teaching me that there is rarely ever a typical situation. The right answer is dependent on many variables which have to be considered, systematically. Professor Blizard for making me think about why things are the way they are and to have my own thoughts. Finally, Professor Pemberton for once telling me I look good for the University. I still donâ€™t completely know what she meant but it meant a lot to me to hear it. There are many more but these people have stood out the most.

<strong>On working with Skanska USA Building:</strong>

The experience I have gained the last 6 years is invaluable. The projects, the people, the constant grind of daily operations is world class. We are a large company, no doubt, but we are also a family. I probably had 15 coworkers at my wedding! My experience has also been quite varied. While I have had a few titles, I have worn many hats. From Business Development, to running jobs early on in my career as a Project Engineer there is never a shortage of challenging opportunities, nor a dull moment.

<strong>His typical workday:</strong>

Senior Project Engineer is a position on the path to becoming a Project Manager (I have since been promoted to Asst. Project Manager). I spent a year in the field as an Asst. Superintendent to get some field experience and help the project out where it was needed the most. My desire has always been to be a Project Manager so moving back to the office after a year was a smooth transition. My typical day would start at 7am with stretch and flex then into helping the field get lined out for the day. This would often include getting new subs through orientation, delivery coordination, and making sure they knew where to go. After this the remainder of my day was spent on quality assurance and control, permit coordination (many of them on a large healthcare job), sub coordination and documentation, and sometimes back in the field to help answer questions and follow up on RFIs that need to be written. Some days are full of meetings, from sub coordination meetings, schedule meetings, owner meetings, and MEP meetings. There really are no typical days as a Senior Project Engineer!

<strong>On recent or notable projects:</strong>

The Methodist Expansion was and will be the most notable project for me for a long time. It was an enormous challenge to me both professionally and personally. From spending four days straight at work during rain events, to dressing up as Chewbacca for the Childrenâ€™s Hospital on Halloween, I have had my best days and worst days of my construction career all in one project. When I would have a bad day there I would remind myself of what we are building and who we are building it for. It really helped me put the big picture out in front so I can keep pushing toward it.

<strong>On winning the 2017 Skanska Texas Project Engineer of the Year Award:</strong>

Winning project engineer of the year means a few things to me. First, it means that I have earned the respect and confidence of my colleagues, since yearly awards are typically voted on. Second, it means that all the hard work and late nights/early mornings, and heart and soul put into what I do was noticed. I have never been satisfied just coming in and punching the clock and collecting a check. I want to leave a mark. When my time is up, nothing I do at work will matter, but the lessons I pass down will matter, and who I pass them down to will matter the most. I want the next generation to know what it means to pour yourself into what you love and believe in.

<strong>On attending every UTSA Construction Science Career Fair as a recruiter since he graduated:</strong>

At first, there was a need for someone to attend the career fairs and it made sense for it to be me due to being the only UTSA Alumni in Texas at the time. I already had the connectivity to the CSM Department and would have an idea of the candidates since I was in class with a lot of them. I also know how hard it can be to find an internship and full-time job in an experience-based industry when you have no experience! You would think that a Marine with eight years active duty, combat experience and now a degree would be a shoe in for a job right away, but you would be surprised. I was passed on a few times before I got a call back from Skanska. It can be discouraging to say the least, but if I can offer anything to the students, it is a message of resilience and persistence. My career advancement will only mean something to me if I help others.

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>

There is unlimited power in believing in yourself and donâ€™t be afraid to fail. Too often we are afraid to do something because we may not succeed, or we are afraid of looking stupid. Failure to me means I figured out how not to do something but I believe in myself and I believe that I am going to try again. There is a Japanese proverb that I find very suiting to this:Â Nanakorobi yaoki â€“ Fall Seven Times and Stand Up Eight. All you have to do is stand up one more time!

15293,Ruby City: Sir David Adjaye Documentary Series on October 10,"<div>

Studio | 111 Camp Street, San Antonio, TX 78204

Second Wednesdays 6:00 to 8:30 pm | June through December 2018

Free &amp; Open to the Publicâ€” RSVP required events@rubycity.org

&nbsp;

(June 19, 2018) -- Ruby City and the UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning present the screening of two documentaries focusing on the work of world-renowned architect David Adjaye. Screenings of <em>David Adjaye â€“ Collaborations</em> (50 min) and <em>This Building Will Sing for All of Us</em> (30 min) take place at Studio (111 Camp Street) the second Wednesday of every month from 6:00 to 8:30pm. These films are not available to the public, offering a rare opportunity to learn more about this important architect, his creative process and work. The documentaries will be presented consecutively with a 10-minute intermission.

<em>David Adjaye â€“ Collaborations</em> is a feature length documentary on the work of British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye. The film features interviews with AdjayeÂ´s collaborators, a roster of influential figures in the art and cultural world as well as a significant number of his architectural projects, including public buildings, residential houses, artist studios and exhibition spaces globally situated and developed over the past 15 years. The collaborators â€“ artists, curators and writers, most of them interviewed â€˜on siteâ€™ â€“ give creative insights into Adjayeâ€™s buildings, while offering a highly personal perspective on their particular collaboration.

In <em>This Building Will Sing for All of Us</em> Oliver Hardt explores Adjayeâ€™s design for the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C. The film focuses on the question of how Adjaye deals with the challenge of building one of the most important buildings in African American history. What role does â€œAfricanâ€ play in the idea of â€œAfrican American?â€ And in what form are historical, social and aesthetic considerations manifested in his design for the museum?

Refreshments for guests will be served.

15298,UTSA CACP 2018-19 Speaker Series continues November 5 with Andrew John Wit,"<div>

(October 31, 2018) -- The UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planningâ€™s (CACP) 2018-19 Speaker Series continues with Andrew John Wit, Co-Founder of the interdisciplinary research group wito*: Laboratory for Intelligent Environments and Assistant Professor of Digital Practice at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. There he leads research, courses, and workshops focused around novel building systems generated through light-weight composites, novel production tools, and robotic systems. In his talk, â€œFrom Composites to Robotics: Reimagining the Fields of Architecture and Design,â€ Wit will explore how the integration of materials such as carbon fiber-reinforced polymers and collaborative machines for robotic production can help redefine the built environment. The event is free and open to the public and will take place at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, November 5 in the Frio Street Buildingâ€™s Riklin Auditorium (FS 1.406) on the UTSA Downtown Campus.

Over the past three decades novel material, computation, and production-based technologies have provided many formal and efficiency-based affordances to the design and construction community. Although they embody an immense potential to redefine the built environment, we have seen these materials and techniques implemented merely as a means of economic benefit through the construction of the same types of artifacts, rather than solving novel problems and bettering the built environment. Framed by his recent research and projects, and publications such as the book <em>Towards a Robotic Architecture</em> which he co-edited with Mahesh Daas, Witâ€™s talk will explore potential trajectories for the fields of design and architecture when not bound by the current disciplinary preconceptions.

Witâ€™s research and projects have been highly disseminated and recognized, and his work has been featured in numerous galleries, international conferences, and refereed publications. UTenSAils received the 2007 AIA Best of Practice Award and the Advanced Fabrics Exhibition received the 2007 IFAI Outstanding Achievement Award, while his Underwood Pavilion, woven carbon fiber installation rolyPOLY, and carbon fiber kites of cloudMAGNET have been widely published. Professionally, Wit has practiced in renowned offices such as Poteet Architects in San Antonio, as well as with Atelier Bow-Wow, TDStudio, and the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Toyo Ito in Tokyo. He received his MArch from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his BS in Architecture from the University of Texas at San Antonio.

The international organization for World Town Planning Day (WTPD) was founded in 1949 by Professor Carlos Maria della Paolera of the University of Buenos Aires to advance public and professional interest in planning, both locally and abroad. Since then, WTPD is celebrated in 30 countries on four continents each November. It is a special day to recognize and promote the role of planning in creating livable communities. We believe World Town Planning Day presents an excellent opportunity to look at urban and regional planning from a global perspective.

As has been indicated by the American Planning Association we celebrate World Town Planning Day:

â€¢ to draw attention to the aims, objectives, and progress of urban and regional planning around the globe

â€¢ to engage local citizens and officials in the value of planning and to participate in shaping their community

â€¢ to highlight the valuable contributions sound planning has made to the quality of global human settlements and their environment

â€¢ to give worldwide coverage to the ideals of urban and regional planning not only within the profession but also among the general public

15326,Art exhibit by UTSA faculty member Analy Diego '08 '11 to benefit UTSA scholarships,"<div>

(November 13, 2018) -- In honor of San Antonioâ€™s Tricentennial, The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Interior Design Program Coordinator, instructor and alumna Analy Diego â€™08 â€™11 will provide original artwork for an auction and sale benefiting scholarships for the UTSA Department of Architecture. Diego is donating her time in creating the artwork, which will be auctioned and sold during a public exhibition titled â€œIconic Architecture.1.â€ The event is scheduled from 6 to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, December 4 at AIA San Antonio, 1344 S. Flores, Ste. 102 and includes an art talk by Diego at 7 p.m.

Fourteen original artworks, numbered and signed, will be auctioned during the event, while a total of 300 prints will be available for sale.

A registered interior designer in Texas, Diego is also an artist whose work reflects pop culture, architecture, and design; she uses it as a vessel for sharing her views, ideas, and personal stories relative to her community. Though Diego has dabbled in many traditional mediums, she found technology to be her tool of choice. Her graphic illustrations are meticulously rendered with emphasis on color, pattern, and proportions.

â€œI am a proud UTSA alumna and it is very important to me to give back to my community and university,â€ said Diego. â€œAs an interior designer and professor, my goal is to organize an annual architecture and art show for UTSA in which all proceeds are used to create scholarships for our interior design and architecture students.â€

Diego graduated with a Masterâ€™s in Architecture and a Historic Preservation concentration from the UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning (CACP) in 2011 and a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Interior Design, Magna Cum Laude in 2008.

The â€œIconic Architectureâ€ collection is a representation of Diegoâ€™s professional and artistic journey, and her perception of architecture as one of the most intricate and expressive art forms. In future annual shows, she plans to include both student and faculty works that will be curated after each semester and exhibited at the end of each year.

â€œIt is always rewarding as a college Dean to see alumni want to give back,â€ said John Murphy, Ph.D., dean of the UTSA CACP. â€œAnaly Diego represents an ever-strengthening relationship being developed between our past, present and future students. Her support through this scholarship fundraising event is far reaching and impactful.â€

Wittigs is the Title Sponsor of the December 4 event. Orange Sponsors are AIA San Antonio, Chesney Morales Partners Inc., Workplace Resource, Sol Studio Architects, and Lone Star Reprographics, while White Sponsors are RVK Architects, The Jordan Group, Modern in San Antonio, and Metropolitan Contracting. Door prizes have been donated by Herman Miller. Attendees are asked to RSVP to the UTSA Department of Architecture at roxanne.cuevas@utsa.edu or 210-458-3010 by November 30.

15333,Class project challenges UTSA students to design a mental health hospital,"<div>

(January 9, 2019) -- Over the last year, students in the UTSA Department of Architecture have developed preplanning and architectural design proposals for the new psychiatric care facility of San Antonio State Hospital (SASH)â€™s southeast campus. This collaboration was proposed by UT Health San Antonio, which has contracted with the State of Texas to develop a high level design for the new SASH hospital.

The project, made possible by a grant from the UT Health San Antonio, was undertaken by Sedef Doganer (chair) and Neda Norouzi, faculty members in the Department of Architecture. To provide students with hands-on experience and to complement their classroom learning, Norouzi challenged her undergraduate students to develop design ideas that break through the mental health stigma.
<p>&gt;&gt; Watch this video to learn more about the 2018 Architecture Design Studio.</p>
The project started with extensive research on best practices of psychiatric care hospitals. The students reviwed existing literature on patient-centered care, campus planning and interior spatial layouts of psychiatric hospitals as well as the needs of different demographics using the state hospital. Additionally, they conducted assessments of the hospitalâ€™s existing condition, building evaluations and site analyses to better understand the new hospitalâ€™s needs.

By the end of Spring 2018 semester, phase one of the project, architecture students developed and presented eight different design scenarios to health care professional architects, landscape architects and interior designers from San Antonio firms as well as the San Antonio State Hospital members and executive committee.

Phase two started in the early summer. The research team including Norouzi, undergraduate Christian Garcia â€˜18 and graduate student Phu Trinh conducted one-on-one interviews with members of the hospital including physicians, nurses, administrators and staff to learn about the specific needs of each group from the built environment of the new hospital. The analyzed transcription of the collected data was the foundation for phase three.

Norouzi, whose expertise and interest is in health care architecture, encouraged and helped her undergraduate students to apply for research scholarship awards. She then mentored these students through literature review, data collection and analysis and the presentation of their findings. Five students won university best research award in the 2018 Undergraduate Research and creative inquiry showcase.

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CACPproject340_NorouziDoganer.jpg"" alt="""" />Phase three of the UTSA project included architecture and interior design students plus two more research assistants, Carlos Rodriguez-Ramirez, a graduate student, and Jose Castilo, a sophomore undergraduate student. The interior design students, taught by professor Analy Diego, worked on further developing the interior of the top four projects from phase one, while Norouziâ€™s second architecture studio developed an additional four design scenarios for the hospital. In this phase, Doganer and Norouzi invited guest lecturers from the local and national health care design community to lecture the students and review their projects.

In talking about this project, Doganer emphasized the importance of community engagement and research being part of successful undergraduate educational frameworks. â€œThrough research and community engagement, our students learn about the importance of civic responsibilities and collaboration, as well as leadership, humanity, and the role of an architect in society. This strengthens community ties, offers employment opportunities for students, and provides services to our local population. Health care design is a very important sub-discipline in architecture and our students are excelling on this area with real world challenges.â€

Norouzi also talked about the importance of architecture education as it models professional behavior.Â  â€œMy pedagogical focus is on the process of collaboration between design practice and academia. I view design as a link between every day issues and the built environment, and the designer as a collaborator in creating the physical environment that serves people. Through this project, we focused on psychiatric health care and the effect of the built environment on patients and staff behavior, safety and quality of life. We involved undergraduate and graduate students in the research process which is not always the norm in architecture but a very important factor as it models the professional architecture practice.â€

In all, 42 undergraduate students participated in the Spring 2018 and Fall 2018 cohorts, assisted by two graduate research assistants and two undergraduate research scholarship students. As the semesters progressed, the students were tasked with creating architectural drawings (floor plans, sections and elevations), developing 3D digital representation of interior and exterior spaces and building architectural physical model(s) correspondent with each design scenario.

â€œDesigning for psychiatric patients requires a deeper understanding of Architecture and the principle â€˜Form follows Functionâ€™. This studio provided me with insight on how to better design for the end user and be aware of the impact of architecture on human psychology. I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in this project and for the knowledge I have gained through the extensive research and design process. This studio has and will continue to strengthen my skills as an aspiring architect,â€ said Christian Garcia.

To culminate the project, the UTSA architecture and interior design students presented their research findings, their methods and their preliminary designs to SASH stakeholders and community members. They were evaluated on functionality, safety, amenities and cost efficiency.

The top three projects of all three studios chosen by local health care designers will be send out through a survey for San Antonio State Hospital members and their executive committee to vote on one top project. All of the research and the top design projects will be published in a book made available to the university.

15363,New STEM designation for UTSA's Master of Architecture and Master of Science in Architecture program,"<div>

(January 16, 2019) -- The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Department of Architecture is pleased to announce that the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has designated both the Master of Architecture and the Master of Science in Architecture as STEM programs through a new STEM CIP-code. The Classification of Instructional Programs (or â€œCIP codeâ€) is a government-developed designation for academic programs, according to the primary subject matter of the programsâ€™ content. It has become a means of identifying areas of study that would be targeted for benefits, including funding and visa status. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) is a grouping of academic disciplines identified to proactively improve competitiveness in science and technology development in the U.S. curriculum.

Having both graduate programs recognized with the new STEM CIP-code (04.0902) will open a range of opportunities, explained Dr. Sedef Doganer, Chair of the Department of Architecture. This includes an additional 24 months of Optional Practice Training (OPT) for international students, with a total of 36 months of OPT employment after degree completion, which enhances their opportunities to secure work visas at the end of their educational career.

â€œIt will not only improve the number of minority students that have access to STEM-related opportunities, but also will be a great competitive tool for recruiting high-caliber international students to our programs,â€ said Doganer. â€œCurrently we are one of very few schools nationwide to have a STEM CIP-code for our MArch and MSArch programs and the only school in the state of Texas. This puts UTSA architecture at the forefront of the discipline, breaking new ground for architectural research, education, and practice.â€

The UTSA Department of Architecture previously included STEM-related content in program offerings and a strong segment of architecture faculty already conduct STEM-related research. With two unique graduate programs serving the state and region, UTSA will provide potential career paths that will fill a need in the architectural profession to bolster design intentions and ideas with sound research-based solutions. Research and development are primary in improving and developing key concepts related to sustainability and problem solving for the specific user groups for which architects design, and the designation will lead to increased research opportunities and available funding for students and faculty.

â€œThis is a designation that is long overdue, as we, as an architecture discipline, have always employed an applied STEM approach to both our architectural education and our professional practice,â€ said John Murphy, Ph.D., Dean of the College of Architecture, Construction and Planning at UTSA.

Architects not only apply advanced technologies and sustainable principles to building design and construction, they also lead multidisciplinary teams of designers, engineers, and consultants to effectively integrate building systems and improve the public health and welfare. However, the academic grouping known as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) has long been regarded as the antithesis to the creative fields of art, music, and architecture.[1] In related national news, the United States Congress passed the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technology Education (CTE) Act in early January, which will lead to architecture being officially recognized as a STEM subject. The bi-partisan act will allow states to use federal funds to modernize the CTE curriculum, allowing for an increase in available funds for high-school-level architectural education. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) lobbied for the change for several years, in the meantime bringing design to K-12 students through special programs and activities, and the bill will formalize these efforts.[2]

15398,UTSA Urban Planning's Bill Barker Speaks with Leadership San Antonio,"<div>

(April 26, 2019) -- The Transportation and Mobility Team of the 44th class of Leadership San Antonio invited UTSA Adjunct Associate Professor of Urban Planning Bill Barker, FAICP, to speak to the class of nearly 100 about the history of transportation and the needs for future transportation. His advice to have the class members actually experience various alternative modes of transportation, including walking, was integrated into the program as well.

Class member Ms. Jessica Peoples, who was part of the Transportation and Mobility Team, noted that Prof. Barkerâ€™s transportation statistics were â€œeye opening.â€ The class members â€œhave a new-found appreciation for the topic of transportation and what it means to all San Antonians,â€ she said.

Leadership San Antonio is the premiere leadership program in the state of Texas. Formed in 1975 by the Chamber of Commerce, it has graduated more than 1,500 participants. In 1992, the San Antonio Hispanic Chamber helped co-host the program and subsequently enhanced the involvement and diversity of future classes. The program has provided a forum in which leaders with diverse backgrounds, values and points of view come together in a neutral setting, examine the nature and inner workings of San Antonio, and discuss the issues, challenges and problems facing our community. Previous class members have graduated to serve in local, state, and federal politics, as well as CEOs and Presidents of private-sector businesses and not-for-profit organizations.

Former Congressman Charlie Gonzalez, himself one of the first graduates of Leadership San Antonio and the moderator for the April 3, 2019 transportation panel, recommended Barkerâ€™s participation.

Photo gallery: 2019 National Planning Conference

(May 1, 2019) -- The American Planning Associationâ€™s 2019 National Conference (NPC19) was an outstanding learning experience for the UTSA students who travelled to San Francisco, CA to attend. The conference, held April 13-16, was an opportunity to experience a multitude of planning perspectives through various seminars, which students attended based on each studentâ€™s individual planning interests. In addition to seminars, the students also partook in GIS workshops and were given the opportunity to interact with numerous new planning technologies. The learning experiences did not end at the conference seminars, as several networking mixers allowed UTSA students to develop national networking connections with professional planners, mentors, APA leaders, and planning students, and promoted the UTSA planning program on a national level.

NPC19 provided UTSA students insight into all the leadership opportunities available within APA, its divisions, and regional chapters. Throughout the conference there were several opportunities to join divisions of each studentâ€™s interest and attend associated business meetings. Students also learned of upcoming elections for their respective divisions of interest and regional chapters. As a result, Marco Hinojosa was nominated Secretary of the Southwest Texas Chapter of APA and Jana Punelli was nominated Treasurer of the Southwest Texas Chapter of APA (election results pending for both nominations), Veronica Escalera-Ibarra was appointed Southern Region Student Representative of the Latinos in Planning Division of APA, and many students were able to select their divisions of interest for the following year.

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Street_Car_2.jpg"" alt="""" />In addition to the conference, NPC19 gave the UTSA students an opportunity to experience the planning and development of the City of San Francisco. Students walked San Francisco districts and neighborhoods and experienced the cityâ€™s street system, marveled at the architecture and historic preservation, contemplated neighborhood density and mixed-use development, and explored the Cityâ€™s open space networks in Golden Gate Park, Yerba Gardens, Landâ€™s End, and Alamo Plaza.

Traveling through San Francisco, the students were true urbanists as they utilized the BART system, city buses, bicycles, scooters, and trolleys. Students also engaged with San Francisco residents about homelessness, displacement, and affordable housing issues affecting the city and learned of city initiatives to combat these issues. San Francisco welcomed students into its cultural districts, Japan Town, China Town, the Mission District, and the Castro District, and impressed the students with how the city had made efforts to retain its cultural identity.

NPC19 and the City of San Francisco provided a unique planning experience for UTSA planning students, allowed the students to develop strong connections amongst themselves, and exhibited the varying planning careers the students will continue to pursue.

15422,Dr. Jae Yong Suk receives Best Paper Award at 2019 ARCC conference,"<div>

(June 3, 2019) -- Congratulations to UTSA assistant professor Dr. Jae Yong Suk, who was honored with the Best Paper Award at the 2019 Architectural Research Centers Consortium (ARCC) conference, held from May 29 - June 1. The conference, â€œFuture Praxis: Applied Research as a Bridge Between Theory and Practice,â€ was hosted by Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada.

Below is a brief description of Dr. Suk's study: ""Can hourly-based annual daylighting simulations predict daylight availability in dynamic sky?""

<em>For successful daylight harvesting in buildings, daylight availability should be accurately evaluated and predicted. The study shows how quickly and drastically an indoor luminous environment has changed under the actual sky conditions and concludes that hourly-based daylighting simulations using a weather data file cannot make accurate predictions of daylight performance in dynamic sky conditions. The findings can help daylighting design professionals to be aware of potential issues of daylighting simulations under dynamic sky conditions.</em>

All papers from ARCC 2019 can be accessed on the ARCC Conference Repository. The repository is publicly available and is indexed by OCLC WorldCat and Google Scholar in an OAI compliant database. This ensures that researchers affiliated with ARCC have significant exposure of their work.

The ARCC conference awards are determined through a two-stage process. First, the results of the double-blind peer review are used to identify a number of short-listed papers. Then a committee of experts representing the range of research topics and approaches of ARCC members selects the award recipient. This yearâ€™s committee included: Philip Plowright, Editor-in-Chief of ENQ, the ARCC Journal and Professor of Architecture, Lawrence Technological University, Erin Moore, Head of the School of Architecture &amp; Environment, and Associate Professor, University of Oregon, and Adil Sharag-Eldin, Associate Professor of Architecture, Kent State University.

15426,"Construction Industry Plagued By Labor Shortages Nationwide, Including in San Antonio","<div>

UTSA Construction Industry Advisory Council (CIAC) member Doug McMurry, Executive Vice President of San Antonio Chapter of AGC, was a featured guest on Texas Public Radio's The Source on June 4, 2019. During the program, he shared information about UTSA's Construction Science program, Mr. McMurry! He and Jeff Buell, president of Greater San Antonio Builders Association and co-owner of Sitterle Homes - San Antonio, were invited to discuss workforce development and the current labor shortages in the construction industry, both nationwide and specifically in San Antonio. Audio for the full interview is found at the link below.

""There are several different avenues,"" said McMurry when asked if people can pick up the necessary skills through attending school. ""As you probably know, thereâ€™s a great high school in San Antonio, Earl Warren High School. They have a construction careers academy and are doing a fabulous job. In higher education, UTSA has a construction science and management program that is graduating a lot of great folks who are going right into the industry. About 20% of those, interestingly, coming out of UTSA are women and about 56% are Hispanic. So when we think, on the commercial side, about workforce development, we think about diversity and inclusion, and we think about doing a better job of outreach.""

Photo Gallery: Studio X Outdoor Classroom

(June 3, 2019) -- Studio X, a design-build architecture studio in the UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning led by Lecturer Darryl Ohlenbusch, designed and built an outdoor classroom during the Spring 2019 semester in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Green Spaces Alliance of South Texas. This structure, â€œThe Monarch,â€ is located at Bulverde Oaks Nature Preserve and it will be used to educate children and adults about the importance of nature conservation and sustainability. An Open House was held on June 2, commemorating the completion of the project. â€œThe Monarchâ€ is not accessible to the public daily, but it can be accessed with an appointment through Green Spaces Alliance.

The project's design was inspired by the monarch butterflies that can be found throughout the site. The studio aimed to design a structure that is open to the nature around it but also provides a space that is shaded and protected from the elements. It appears to â€œlift upâ€ like a butterfly taking off, while the roof was designed to be a butterfly roof to help achieve this effect.

â€œThe Monarchâ€ is made up of three steel and wooden structure frames that are symmetrically identical, aligned, and connected. The frames were designed with modularity in mind to help ease construction and to keep costs down. Wooden girders are cross-axial and supported by two steel columns on parallel ends of the structure. To provide shading, the top of the girders are covered by corrugated roofing panels while the bottom girder utilizes trellis panels to shade the east and west sides. Corrugated metal roofing provides complete shade and protects the classroom space from inclement weather, while the trellis panels provide fifty percent shading and are transparent enough to give an unobstructed view of the trees. The roofing panels slope downward to direct rainwater into a gutter located on the central axis of the structure, which drains water to the back of the structure and into a water tank so it can be collected. A closet was built on the south side to hold trail tools and classroom supplies with a whiteboard in front.

Urban Future Lab highlighted as a model of experiential learning.

(October 14, 2019) -- Dr. Antonio Petrov, Associate Professor in the College of Architecture, Construction and Planning and Founder of the Urban Future Lab, is one of five faculty invited to serve on UTSAâ€™s new Community-Based Research, Sustainable Partnerships, &amp; Advocacy Task Force. As part of UTSA President Taylor Eighmyâ€™s new Initiative on Westside Community Partnerships, the task force seeks to incubate advocacy and strategic community partnerships, collaborating with neighborhoods, community leaders, and UTSA faculty to provide scholarly expertise on community-based research and policy issues. Through this initiative, the university â€œaims to balance campus growth with the preservation of existing community assetsâ€”the heritage, artistic legacies, social movements, and strong neighborhood identity that shape San Antonioâ€™s Westside,â€ said Eighmy.

Dr. Petrovâ€™s invitation to serve on the new task force builds on his engagement in San Antonioâ€™s communities, his previous service on UTSAâ€™s Student Success Task Force, which is one of President Eighmyâ€™s first Presidential Initiatives, and projects he and his students developed in the Urban Future Lab. Under the umbrella of transportation, infrastructure, urban design, and hybrid community engagement, culminating in what they term â€œcreative public-interest engineering,â€ the spectrum of projects ranges from large-scale urban interventions like a vision for the SA airport 2068 and the implementation of a $250-million hybrid infrastructure and multi-modal transportation system along Broadway, to community-based research like the Southside Pilot. In focus, however, are the rapidly changing dynamics of urban futures and how to integrate them into a reciprocal dialogue, providing students and the community a platform to resolve challenges. Key is to find balance between the human and physical environments and how this leads to agency for students and community members, inspiring them to take leadership in shaping and safeguarding the environment. This translates into real-world projects, applied research, and engagement, fostering skills that have proven significant in preparing students for future jobs. This is due to the dedication of UTSA students but the lab has also been able to recruit multi-disciplinary visiting scholars from Cornell University, Universidad AutÃ³noma de Tamaulipas, and Sunmoon University in Korea. As a result, the lab has been highlighted as a model of experiential learning, underscored by its advocacy and responsiveness in community-engagement and the exceptional research and hands-on learning opportunities this creates for students. It became a hub for collaborators of all disciplines, exemplifying the universityâ€™s push to create student-centric environments, though which the next generation engages in transformational experiences while impacting the lives of others. Most recently, the lab and the Southside Pilot were featured in UTSA Sombrilla Magazineâ€™s â€œExperiential Learningâ€ issue, in the article â€œThink &amp; Do: Students translate community vision into value and aspiration in UTSAâ€™s Urban Future Labâ€.

15439,UTSA to research environmental comfort at the San Antonio Missions,"<div>

<img src=""http://cacp.utsa.edu/images/uploads/Establishing_Shot_ConcepciÃ³n_3_(Large).jpg"" alt="""" />

(June 24, 2019) -- Working with local architecture firm Ford, Powell &amp; Carson and the Archdiocese of San Antonio, the UTSA Center for Cultural Sustainability (CCS) will conduct a 12-month assessment of indoor climate management and make recommendations for energy-efficient upgrades at Mission ConcepciÃ³n.

Antonio Martinez-Molina, an assistant professor in the UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning, is leading the project. He has almost a decadeâ€™s experience conducting energy-efficient upgrades to historic buildings, while ensuring the appearance of the historic structures remains intact.

â€œIf you go to ConcepciÃ³n right now, you can see the walls are suffering,â€ said Martinez-Molina. â€œA 265-year-old fresco has already been lost. The point of this research is to create a new methodology to assess buildings, then provide technical guidance to mitigate future damage,â€ he added.

The projectâ€™s primary innovation lies in his holistic approach. It will blend historic preservation, building performance, energy efficiency and a desire to keep the people who are using the building more comfortable.

â€œA comfortable building is more likely to remain in use and, in turn, more likely to remain well-preserved,â€ Martinez-Molina explains. â€œModern-day parishioners expect a certain level of comfort inside the church during the summer months and an active congregation is essential to the outstanding universal values of this UNESCO World Heritage site.â€

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EduardoSanchez_MollyPadilla2_c.jpg"" alt="""" />The UTSA researchers will analyze the buildingâ€™s electricity bills to get a better understanding of how much energy is being used. At the same time, churchgoers will be invited to participate in a survey gauging their comfort levels. Finally, thermal photography and other assessment technologies will be used to analyze the missionâ€™s walls to learn where humidity is concentrated.

The CCS anticipates that the results will serve as a model for other historic stone structures in hot-humid climates throughout the South and Southwest, potentially allowing the San Antonio Missions to become pioneers in the use of energy-efficient upgrades at cultural heritage resources in the US.

The Mission ConcepciÃ³n project was born from another UTSA project, when CCS researchers were completing a condition assessment of ConcepciÃ³nâ€™s convento structures for the National Park Service. The structures lie adjacent to and in some places share a wall with the church.

During that 2018 project, UTSA researchers William Dupont and Angela Lombardi discovered a higher degree of degradation in the walls closest to the HVAC systemâ€™s exterior condenser unit. They found green grass surrounding the condenser unit, indicating high levels of moisture in the soil, conditions that negatively impact 18th century building materials.

After seeing Dr. Lombardiâ€™s photos, UTSA CCS Director Dupont contacted preservationists at Ford, Powell &amp; Carson as well as leaders at the Archdiocese to discuss the findings. Together, they embarked on a plan to study and preserve Mission ConcepciÃ³n.

â€œOf course, our colleague Carolyn Peterson at Ford, Powell &amp; Carson (FPC) was already aware of the concerns and had a plan to upgrade the old A/C unit, which was installed in 1994,â€ said Dupont. â€œTogether with Farther David Garcia, parish priest at ConcepciÃ³n, we discussed the necessity of having a happy congregation as well as a happy building. The Texas Historical Commission was consulted, and the Archdiocese asked FPC to engage CCS in a comprehensive analysis of the buildingâ€™s performance to better assure a successful design solution.â€

Martinez-Molina specializes in energy efficiency and in energy-efficient upgrades for historic buildings. He has worked on similar projects in Europe as a research fellow with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and as a research associate at the Low Carbon Built Environment research center in Cardiff University in the United Kingdom.

Dupont is a San Antonio Conservation Society Endowed Professor at UTSA, an architect and expert in heritage conservation. He is active locally and internationally in heritage preservation: consulting, teaching, writing and researching. He directs the Center for Cultural Sustainability (CCS), a research center which undertakes design, documentation and planning projects with a focus on the cultural heritage continuity of places, engaging faculty and students for the benefit of people and their communities.

Lombardi specializes in historic preservation. Her research focus is on the management of historic built heritage and archaeology within contemporary urban landscapes in an international context. Her professional work has focused on the investigation and preservation of historic masonry and traditional construction techniques, and the adaptive reuse of existing buildings, including interior design.

UTSA is an urban serving university committed to tackling San Antonioâ€™s grand challenges. Guided by its 10-year strategic plan, it is rapidly becoming a model for student success, a great research university, and an institution of strategic growth and innovative excellence.

13564,Faculty Spotlight - Amir Karimi,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Amir Karimi, Ph.D.</strong>is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering in UTSA's College of Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><br />I was born in Tehran, Iran. I completed my elementary and high school education in Tehran. I came to the United States for college education. I started my education in a private junior college (Multnomah College) in Portland, Oregon and received an Associate Degree in Pre-engineering from that college. At the time, no public community college existed in Oregon. I met my wife while I was attending junior college and she was a freshman student at Portland State University. Shortly after we married, and our first son was born right before I completed my associate degree.Â <br />I transferred to Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR), where I received a BS degree in Metallurgical Engineering and a BS degree in Mathematics.<br />We moved back to Portland for my wife to complete her college degree at Portland State University, and I attended the University of Portland to pursue my graduate education in Mechanical Engineering. After receiving my MS degree, we moved to Lexington, Kentucky for me to pursue a PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering, focusing on Thermal Sciences. Our second son was born shortly after we moved to Lexington.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><br />Currently, I am a Professor at the department of Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><br />When I was close to completing my PhD degree, I started to search for a job either in academia, research organizations, or industry. At early stages of the jobÂ hunt, I noticed an announcement posted in the department advertising faculty positions in start-up engineering programs at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I decided to apply for one of the positions in mechanical engineering in the Division of Engineering (now College of Engineering) while applying for positions in other universities and research organizations. Shortly after submitting my application, I was invited to interview at UTSA. A few days after visiting UTSA, I was offered a mechanical engineering faculty position. I accepted the position because I found the job of developing a brand-new engineering program to be exciting and challenging. I joined the newly established Division of Engineering at UTSA in 1982. During the first year, I was the only faculty in the mechanical engineering program <br />As the founding faculty member of the mechanical engineering program, I had the opportunity of playing a lead role in the development of undergraduate and graduate mechanical engineering programs. Due to the limited number of faculty in the program during the early years, I developed and taught a wide spectrum of engineering courses (19 undergraduate and seven graduate courses). In addition to teaching courses in thermal sciences, I taught courses in materials engineering, manufacturing, numerical methods, and capstone design. I supervised design and honors research projects, directed graduate theses, and special projects. I devoted significant effort and leadership to laboratory development at UTSA, including the creating of initial laboratory capabilities (1982-4) in Measurement and Instrumentation, Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics, and Thermal Science. <br />I led the effort of writing the proposals for establishment of the MS degree program in Mechanical Engineering (1987-9), and compiling the self-study report for this program in 1996. <br />I have held several administrative positions while at UTSA. I served as the Chair of Mechanical Engineering twice (1987-92 and 1998-2003), Associate Dean of Academic Affair in the College of Engineering (2003-6), and the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies in the Office of Undergraduate Studies (now the University College) (2006-13). <br />From the start of the engineering program, I contributed to the effort for ABET accreditation of the mechanical engineering program at UTSA. I served as the ABET coordinator in the College of Engineering, guiding all engineering programs through two successful accreditation cycles.<br />I have served as the faculty advisor for several student engineering organizations including: Engineering Club (1983-8), ASHRAE (1990-2016), ASME (1985-2001), and the COE Student Council (2003-6).</p>
<p><b>Tell us about your research and what led you to your field.</b><br />My research interests are within the fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, and engineering education. I have conducted both basic and applied research. My research experiences include the specific areas of metastable thermodynamics, laminar film condensation, two-phase flow, sorption refrigeration cycles, thermal storage in phase chance materials, design of energy recovery systems, and computer software development in thermal sciences. I have participated in eight summer research fellowship programs at NASA (JSC, 1990, 1991, and 1997), the Air Force Research and Development Laboratories (School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB, TX, 1983 and 1985; Phillips Laboratory at Kirtland AFB, NM 1992 and 1993), and the Navy (Newport, RI, 1998). Projects involved during the summer research program included the thermal analysis and improvement of the liquid-cooled garment used by astronauts during the extra vehicular activities (spacewalk), by the Air Force personnel during chemical warfare, and the fire fighters; design and evaluation of intermittent liquid cooling system for ground crew personnel; thermal control of NASAâ€™s international space station, storage of fuel and oxygen created from the Mars atmosphere to be used for returning space vehicles to Earth, cryogenic cooling of electronic components of satellites; and conducting thermodynamics analysis for methods used to reduce drag on submarines.</p>
<p><b>Did you go to college with the intention of getting the job you have now? If not, explain how you came to the position youâ€™re in now at the university. Any other jobs lead you here?<br /></b>I developed interest in engineering as a young child. I was always curious about how devices work. I used to take mechanical watches apart and tried to put them back together. I tried to build a transistor radio and running water through a turbine to create electricity. But, I was not sure what it required to be an engineer. The high school I attended helped me to develop my mathematical skills. My original goal was to get a BS degree in engineering and get a job after that. I studied metallurgical engineering as an undergraduate student. When I completed my BS degree in metallurgical engineering, I was not very excited about the work in that field. As a graduate student, I took advanced courses in thermodynamics and heat transfer. I found the area of thermal sciences to be interesting, therefore, after completing my MS degree, I decided to focus more in the area of thermal sciences and applied for admission to a PhD degree program in that field.</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite thing about San Antonio?</b><br />San Antonio has been unique compared to all of the other places I lived before. It is a multi-cultural city and friendly to newcomers. I was introduced to Tex-Mex food here for the first time and liked it very much. Also, food from other cultures are available throughout the city. And, the weather is nice in the winter.</p>

13615,CPS Energy supports clean energy and grid cybersecurity research at UTSA,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>(Sept. 18, 2019) -- Beginning in the Fall of 2019, faculty members at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) will conduct research to enhance green power generation and smart grid security. Through the strategic alliance between the Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute (TSERI) at UTSA and CPS Energy, three new projects totaling approximately $750,000 will focus on improving grid security and resilience, solar energy generation and more efficient technology for power generation.</p>
<p>â€œWe are thrilled to embark on these three new projects that aim to contribute to CPS Energyâ€™s position as a key player in the new energy economy,â€ said <strong>Krystel Castillo</strong>, TSERI Director.</p>
<p>â€œWe have been able to build knowledge and grow innovation through our partnership with UTSA over the past decade,â€ said <strong>Cris Eugster,</strong> CPS Energyâ€™s Chief Operating Officer. â€œWe expect these new projects to also bring new insights that will help us plan for the future of energy.â€</p>
<p>The first project will develop a solar tracking system made of soft silicon rubber for building- integrated photovoltaic applications.</p>
<p>â€œThis light-weight robotic system can be integrated into buildingsâ€™ facades, rooftops or windows to optimize solar energy collected by solar panels while regulating energy flow between indoor and outdoor environments. It will also provide privacy,â€ said <strong>Wei Gao</strong>, project lead and assistant professor in the UTSA Department of Mechanical Engineering. Gao will partner with <strong>Yongcan Cao</strong>, assistant professor in the UTSA Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering to complete the project.</p>
<p>The second project will produce a prototype of a clean energy technology for steam turbines, which currently generate over 80% of the nationâ€™s energy. UTSA researchers set a goal to replace the water used in this cycle with supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2).</p>
<p>â€œA supercritical fluid behaves like both a gas and a liquid at the same time. The phases are indistinguishable and sCO2 happens to have some very convenient properties for power generation that lead to higher efficiency and smaller turbines compared to steam,â€ said <strong>Christopher Combs</strong>, the assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering who will lead this effort along with his co-investigators, <strong>Karan Bhanot </strong>(Finance), <strong>Sara Ahmed </strong>(Electrical and Computer Engineering) and <strong>Kiran Bhaganagar </strong>(Mechanical Engineering).</p>
<p>The third project will design data-driven and artificial intelligence approaches to better identify and mitigate cyber threats occurring on edge-cloud applications. The UTSA researchers will, particularly, focus on Internet of Things (IoT) devices including smart meters to verify the correctness and identify any security vulnerabilities in existing IoT devices as they interact with the smart grid. This project will be led by <strong>Paul Rad </strong>and <strong>Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo</strong>, associate professors in the UTSA Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security in collaboration with Krystel Castillo.</p>
<p>CPS Energy has collaborated with TSERI for close to a decade on multiple efforts such as smart grid cybersecurity, solar forecasting, energy storage, smart buildings and clean energy technologies. These research projects have created learning and workforce development opportunities for UTSA students through summer internships that help them better transition into next-generation energy jobs and sustainability fields. CPS Energy employees will also serve as mentors to the professors and students who will be participating in these newly-announced projects.</p>
<p>TSERI was founded by UTSA in 2010 to leverage the universityâ€™s diverse knowledge in energy and related areas. The institute integrates scientific discovery, engineering innovation and policy deliberations with pragmatic implementation to realize the promise of tomorrowâ€™s America as a global energy leader.</p>

13641,UTSA to host grand opening of Large-Scale Testing Laboratory,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>Sept. 27, 2019 â€“ The University of Texas at San Antonio is cutting the ribbon on one of the most unique research buildings in the country. UTSAâ€™s College of Engineering will host on Oct. 3 at 9:30 a.m. the grand opening of its <a href=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/lstl-2/"">Large-Scale Testing Laboratory,</a> a 50-foot-tall facility where civil engineers can test the structural integrity of systems, such as concrete buildings, in a realistic setting.Â </p>
<p>The $9.95 million Large-Scale Testing Laboratory will serve students and researchers in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, one of the universityâ€™s most innovative areas. Researchers within the department have led work to prevent landslides, create drinkable water from rainfall and harvest energy from hot pavement, among other initiatives.Â </p>
<p>The laboratory will facilitate the testing of components and systems at near 100% scale. Civil engineering students and researchers will build and test structural systems, such as concrete beams, in the 15,000-square-foot facility, supporting a wide array of geotechnical and structural engineering projects. Areas of focus include bridge and building components and new materials needed for increasingly complex construction projects.Â </p>
<p>â€œThis building is one of few of its kind in the country,â€ said <strong>JoAnn Browning,</strong> dean of the College of Engineering. â€œWe are so excited about the capabilities that this facility provides our researchers as we continue to study civil and structural engineering. The laboratory will also be a game changer for our students as they prepare for their civil engineering careers.â€Â </p>
<p>The building has a 40-by-80-foot reaction floor that provides researchers with the ability to test real-size structural systems and components. The reaction floor ranges from 3 feet thick to 5 feet, 6 inches thick and provides the capability to apply test loads up to 4 million pounds of forceâ€”making it one of the highest reaction floor capacities in the United States. Underneath the reaction floor is a basement structure for researchers to secure test specimens and monitor experiments.Â </p>
<p>The Large-Scale Testing Laboratory will give UTSA researchers the capability to test large-scale systems and components with spans of up to 70 feet. Two cranes each with a 30-ton capacity for loading, unloading and transporting heavy specimens are installed in the facility.Â </p>
<p>The test floor area is surrounded by staging and shop areas with a length of 10 feet, which allows testing specimens as long as 90 feet. The clearance between the reaction floor and the bottom of the cranes is 40 feet, providing researchers the ability to test structures as tall as four stories high.Â </p>
<p>A large-capacity hydraulic power supply and high-pressure distribution lines with access manifolds in the service chase facilitate the use of servo-controlled actuators anywhere on the test floor. The hydraulic power supply and distribution system provide the ability for civil and structural engineering researchers to simulate a wide range of issues, including high-cycle fatigue, earthquakes and blast loads.Â </p>
<p>The facility includes support areas for fabrication and instrumentation of specimens; offices for students, faculty and staff; and a conference room where visitors can observe tests as they are performed.</p>

13649,Faculty Spotlight - Hugo Giambini,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hugo Giambini</strong>Â is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><br />I am originally from Argentina, Buenos Aires, the oldest of three brothers, a husband, and a future dad of a beautiful little girl. I moved with my family to the US (Miami, FL) in 2001 when I was 20 years old. Iâ€™m a fan of soccer, music, and barbeque, or asados as we call it. Iâ€™m family oriented, a biomedical engineer, and a translational orthopedic scientist.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><br />I am currently an Assistant Professor in the department of Biomedical Engineering at UTSA and an adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Orthopedics at UT Health. My job can be divided in university, college, and departmental administrative tasks, teaching, and research. Like the saying, â€œfind a job that you like, and you will never work a day in your life,â€ I feel I am never working. I love my job, my research field, colleagues, and students I get to interact with.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><br />In addition to the city and the weather, the short answer is the potential for growth and opportunities. Potential to grow individually as a scientist and as an educator in a minority institution, but also to bring a different vision and perspective that will contribute to a continuous growth of the department and university so it can be established as a leading research institution. There are many opportunities for growth, including interaction with students who always have questions and challenge our thinking, and collaborative research opportunities with various industries or medical institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your research and what led you to your field.</strong><br />My research can be categorized as orthopedic research. Having trained at the Mayo Clinic with an outstanding primary mentor and secondary mentors, provided me with the opportunity to be involved in many different areas and learn various techniques. My research spans from molecular and cell biology, to biomechanics of tissues, imaging using medical equipment (CT, MRI, ultrasound), and modeling and simulations. All of these different approaches are implemented and used in the setting of rotator cuff tears and bone fracture prediction. Our rotator cuff tear research relates to the implementation of novel imaging techniques to better guide surgery and predict re-tear of surgical repairs. We also aim to better understand the soft tissues in the rotator cuff and how these different muscles interact to allow for proper shoulder function and motion. Our other line of research involves developing computer models based on patient specific clinical images to better predict fracture properties of bones in the setting of osteoporosis and cancer metastasis.Â <br />I became passionate about developing predictive tools that we could eventually bring to the clinical setting to improve patient quality of life. In our lab, we are currently working with the goal to develop new techniques and approaches that can aid surgeons, physicians, physical therapist, or others in the clinic with the final goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your college education. Where did you get your bachelorâ€™s degree? Masters, etc.</strong><br />I started my Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering (BME) in the year 2000 in Argentina. After moving to the US, I was accepted as a freshman in BME at Florida International University in 2002. Towards the end of my freshmen year I got involved in a cell and molecular biology lab where I was fortunate to learn various techniques and perform research. In the year 2005, I did a summer research fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and I received my B.S. degree in 2007. Post-graduation, I worked in industry for a year designing, fabricating, and testing biodegradable coronary stents. In the year 2008, I was accepted into the Ph.D. program in BME at the Mayo Clinic, where I graduated in 2013. I then continued doing research as a Post-Doctoral Fellow, then a Senior Post-Doctoral Fellow, Research Associate, and finally as an Assistant Professor in Orthopedics before moving to UTSA in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Did you go to college with the intention of getting the job you have now? If not, explain how you came to the position youâ€™re in now in at the university. Any other jobs lead you here?</strong><br />I think when we start our career we have an idea of what we think we want to do in the future. Although a fun fact, I remember watching the movie Terminator back in high school and thinking, â€œI want to design bionic arms.â€ I did all of my B.S. in BME thinking that I was going to be involved in that type of job or research. Toward the end of my degree, in our senior design project, we designed and manufactured a spine implant to treat vertebral fractures and degeneration. This project paved the road to my current research interests.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start to become interested in engineering?</strong><br />All through high school, I would meet with my friends and we would take our cars apart, fixing new issues, or maybe fixing problems we had created the previous week. I guess cars back then were easier to fix, with simpler engines and no computers. Mechanics, robotics, and the complex human body have always been an interest of mine, and BME was the perfect combination that would allow me to be involved in various aspects.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite holiday?</strong><br />My favorite holiday is New Years. While itâ€™s been on and off for the last couple of years, I get to reunite with my family, enjoy good food, celebrate, relax, and plan our next year tasks and accomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite movie quote?</strong><br />I actually do not have a favorite quote, but I could say, â€œHouston, we have a problem.â€ This quote comes very handy when talking with students and graduate students about their research or classes.</p>
<p><strong>Who would star in the movie about your life?</strong><br />Mmmm, this is tricky! While not my favorite actor, because I do not have one, I think Tom Hanks. While he is a person who maintains a low profile, he is an excellent actor who can play many different roles.</p>

15463,Chris Smith of Zehnder America discusses practices to improve indoor air quality Oct 9,"<div>

As part of CACP Assistant Professor Dr. Antonio Martinez-Molinaâ€™s current Design/Build studio, Chris Smith of Zehnder America will give a talk, â€œImproving Indoor Air Quality Through Energy Recovery Ventilation,â€ from Noon-1pm on Wednesday, October 9. Mr. Smithâ€™s talk is free and open to the public and will be held in the Buena Vista Buildingâ€™s Aula Canaria Auditorium (BV 1.328) on the UTSA Downtown Campus.

As the building industry continues to design and construct more durable, energy-efficient buildings, it is essential to consider the ways in which these environments can benefit occupants. Advanced airtightness in the building envelope is proven to save energy and prolong the life of building assemblies, but also calls for deliberate, controlled, balanced mechanical ventilation.

Mr. Smithâ€™s presentation will provide an overview of the best residential ventilation practices to provide for the health and comfort of the occupants while conserving as much energy as possible. The following are the learning objectives of his talk.

1) Identify the basic factors that affect Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in modern buildings.
2) Understand the basis of codes and certification standards that require mechanical ventilation.
3) Identify the most common types of residential ventilation systems and describe their advantages and disadvantages.
4) Understand the functional principles and best design practices of HRV/ERV systems.

I have always enjoyed the arts: music, painting, acting, and dancing. My concentration in mechanical engineering was thermal/fluids, but I also have an interest in robotics. I still dream of creating a life-changing innovation.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job and title and what do you do?</strong><br />I am a Lecturer in the Mechanical Department. I was also hired as a Lab Manager to improve the teaching labs in Mechanical Engineering. I teach laboratory courses and I oversee the needs of all of our teaching labs so the laboratory experience can be improved for students.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><br />I have been at UTSA since 2000, when I started my Bachelorâ€™s degree. I also completed my Masterâ€™s degree at UTSA. I was an Adjunct Faculty member at UTSA in 2011, and I returned in 2019 as a full-time faculty member. I would say that life brought me back to UTSA and into the realm of academia once again.</p>
<p><strong>What do you find most challenging and rewarding about being an engineer?</strong><br />I love engineering. I stayed away for some time, but it kept calling me back. In industry, being an engineer is exciting because you can directly affect people, devices, structures, etc., depending on your area. At the same time, the challenge is being meticulous about what you do and ensuring that you cover all sides of the problem, while also finding the most efficient way to approach it. While you can positively impact lives and society, you can also make mistakes that are detrimental, so there is an enormous responsibility. This is why I encourage students to pay attention NOW, in their educational career, to begin thinking like they will in the industry. They need to push themselves to think professionally and conscientiously because mistakes in industry are costly. With passion and perseverance, successes in the field are extremely rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>How do you like working on a university campus?</strong><br />Working on a university campus is comfortable, if the campus is UTSA. By comfortable, I mean that I like the UTSA environment and the diversity on our campus. Itâ€™s friendly and it feels like people care about each other. I spent many years as a student, and I feel like I understand student life. I can relate to what goes on, and I want to help students as much as I can. I like to encourage improvement and success among my students. I want them to feel like they have learned something and feel empowered to move on to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>What was your college experience like in general?</strong><br />My college experience was awesome. I had a great time at UTSA. I loved my engineering education at UTSA. My professors were challenging, but I thrive on being challenged to push harder and reach higher. I was very happy with my college experience.</p>
<p><strong>What are three words that best describe you?</strong><br />The three words that best describe me are:<br />Persistent<br />Dedicated<br />Empathetic</p>

15483,UTSA CACP Speaker Series Nov. 4 with Aaron Betsky of The School of Architecture at Taliesin,"<div>

(October 31, 2019) -- The UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning (CACP) 2019-2020 Speaker Series continues with Aaron Betsky, President of the School of Architecture at Taliesin West, the 620-acre Arizona compound designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In his talk, â€œBeyond Buildings: Reimagining Architecture,â€ Mr. Betsky will discuss the need to reimagine and reuse the structures we already have. The event is free and open to the public and will take place at 5:30pm on Monday, November 4 in the Buena Vista Buildingâ€™s Aula Canaria Auditorium (BV 1.328) on the UTSA Downtown Campus.

Mr. Betsky argues that architecture should not be a question of building, but of questioning, opening up, and unbuilding. He reasons that, from an environmental standpoint, non-renewable resources and land cannot be wasted to create new buildings. In his opinion, what makes us at home in the modern world is no longer structures that imprison us, but rather the images, forms, and spaces that let us play active and critical roles in our society. His talk will illustrate recent attempts to make sense of our modern world and to offer responses that either come out of the discipline and knowledge that is proper to architecture, or that address those issues proper to architecture.

A critic of art, architecture, and design, Mr. Betsky is the author of over a dozen books on these subjects, including a forthcoming survey of modernism in architecture and design. He writes a twice-weekly blog for architectmagazine.com, <em>Beyond Buildings</em>. Trained as an architect and in the humanities at Yale University, Mr. Betsky was previously Director of the Cincinnati Art Museum (2006-2014) and the Netherlands Architecture Institute (2001-2006), as well as Curator of Architecture and Design at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1995-2001). In 2008, he also directed the 11th Venice International Biennale of Architecture. His latest books, <em>Making It Modern</em> and <em>Architecture Matters</em>, were published in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Building on Frank Lloyd Wrightâ€™s designs and thoughts, the School of Architecture at Taliesin offers a graduate program in architecture that teaches and practices learning by doing, new ways of looking, an ability to honor and build with the landscape, and experimentation. While the heart of life at Taliesin revolves around the studio and the creative work produced by students in Wrightâ€™s historic drafting rooms, students are encouraged to gain perspective from field trips to local artistsâ€™ workshops, living in and building their own shelter, and joining the community around them. The three-year immersive Master of Architecture (M.Arch) program is designed for students who thrive in a multifaceted environment focusing on rigorous design, critical thinking, and hands-on learning, while the small scale of the School facilitates an individualized educational experience.

(November 8, 2019) -- Conserving historic sites goes beyond protecting a physical structure. Heritage preservation takes into account the identities and values that bind people to places. It is an ongoing effort in a city thatâ€™s best known for its historical significance. The University of Texas at San Antonio has been exploring over 300 years of cultural heritage in South and Central Texas.

William Dupont and Angela Lombardi, Ph.D, said the Alamo City is a prime location for their heritage preservation research, with its deep historical roots intertwined with a rich culture that defines the city.

Dupont, founder of UTSAâ€™s Center for Cultural Sustainability, and Lombardi, coordinator of UTSAâ€™s Historic Preservation Program, have explored how the cityâ€™s current growth rate could have a negative impact on cultural heritage if not planned carefully.

They argued that rapid economic development not only has a high potential to displace people, but can also disrupt living heritage and destroy historical significance. Their research seeks to inform policymakers, community leaders and designers on what can be done in order to protect the cityâ€™s cultural heritage for future generations.

â€œIt's not just the physical things,â€ Dupont said. â€œIt's these things that are connected to people's memories and their beliefs and their spirituality. That's what's really important about historic preservation.â€

Dupont and Lombardi have extensive experience in conservation projects and have had their fair share of disputes with policymakers when they disagree with their research findings. However, they continue to advocate for the importance of preservation and recognize cultural heritage is a fragile topic.

â€œIt's a public policy issue,â€ Lombardi said. â€œIt's very important that professionals from different fields work together in order to find solutions and also to understand the cultural aspects of neighborhood.â€

Dupont and Lombardiâ€™s research also places a strong emphasis on their work with UTSA students, as they help prepare our future leaders who will continue exploring the importance of preserving resources, infrastructure and heritage for future generations.

15500,Architecture alumna Azadeh Sagheb lands finalist spot for prestigious historic preservation award,"<div>

(November 15, 2019) -- A UTSA architecture alumna has received top recognition for her research on the integrity of redeveloped historical sites.

The U.S. National Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites named <strong>Azadeh Sagheb M.S. â€™19</strong> a third-place finalist for the 2019 Murtagh I Graham Prize, the prestigious award for work in the area of historic preservation.

Sagheb, whose master of science in architecture degree at UTSA focused on historic preservation, earned the finalist spot for her thesis, Authenticity and Integrity: Adaptive Reuse of Industrial Heritage Sites in San Antonio.

â€œI am honored to be selected as one of the three finalists. I put so much effort and time into fulfilling a project that could bring immense opportunities for the growth of San Antonio,â€ Sagheb said. â€œI aspire that my project can be considered for implementation by auspicious authorities.â€

Saghebâ€™s research created a rating system for the assessment of integrity for redeveloped historical sites, specifically industrial buildings. The rating system is meant to evaluate the success of a proposed design project before its implementation, considering as a priority retaining the authenticity of the original structures, effectively linking redevelopment, economic impact and preservation.

A preservation architect for the World Heritage Office in San Antonio, Sagheb chose to do a comparative analysis of three case studies for industrial sites within the buffer zone surrounding the UNESCO-designated San Antonio Missions World Heritage Site.

The analysis demonstrates whether the industrial heritage sites can undertake a change of their original use and physical features without affecting value, authenticity and integrity.

â€œThis system could also be utilized for assessing other types of historic buildings and sites,â€ Sagheb said. â€œIt also broadens the spectrum of possible uses to be considered compatible and provides a strategic road map to interconnect neighborhood redevelopment, economic growth and heritage preservation.â€

While she was a student at UTSA working primarily with historic preservation, Sagheb learned a lot about the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park and World Heritage Buffer Zone, which ultimately helped when selecting her thesis topic, she said.

â€œRehabilitating the existing historic buildings will not only help to preserve their historic values but also assist us in building more sustainable neighborhoods and urban environments,â€ she said. â€œI felt so connected to the tangible and intangible heritage of this city. Therefore, I decided to focus and initiate a meaningful and practical project that San Antonians could benefit from.â€

Architecture department chair <strong>Sedef Doganer</strong> and historic preservation program coordinator <strong>Angela Lombardi</strong> cochaired Saghebâ€™s thesis.

â€œWe are so proud of Azadehâ€™s success in this very prestigious national award,â€ Doganer said. â€œThis is also a superior achievement for our historic preservation program within the Department of Architecture, and a milestone to put our program on the map of the great programs in the U.S.â€

With UTSA at the forefront of the 21st century preservation challenges, Lombardi said the students in the program are trained to think â€œglobally, act locally and be able to respond to the unique cultural features of places.â€

â€œAzadehâ€™s work is an outstanding example of our potential. We hope that this award will open fabulous successful opportunities in her future career,â€ Lombardi said. â€œShe demonstrated how preservation theories and regulations can be effectively applied, broadening instead of limiting the spectrum of possible compatible rehabilitation strategies. Her work is exceptional due to her rigorous methodological framework and innovative thinking.â€

<img src=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Team_Picture_Medium.jpg"" alt="""" />

(November 20, 2019) -- University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) architecture students Andre Simon and Ivan Ventura are the winners of the AIA San Antonio 2019 Student Design Award for â€œTransform for Storm,â€ their proposal for an eco-hotel in Galveston, Texas that responds to the extreme environmental circumstances that define the coastal city. Their winning proposal was selected from a very competitive field of entries by the AIA San Antonio 2019 Design Award Committee. Simon and Ventura were honored by AIA San Antonio during the annual People + Place Awards Celebration, held on November 19, 2019 at the McNay Art Museum.

Simon and Ventura developed the project during the 2018 Fall semester under the guidance of UTSA associate professors Ian Caine and Dr. Hazem Rashed-Ali, whose joint studio follows the requirements of the AIA Committee on the Environment (COTE) Top Ten for Students Competition. The studio explored issues of ecological literacy and resilience through the comprehensive integration of advanced performance metrics and design pedagogy, while the combination of Rashed-Aliâ€™s expertise in building performance and Caineâ€™s in architectural design allowed their students to pursue these critical topics in parallel. The studio embraced the goals and methods of the Architecture 2030 Challenge, which commits that all new buildings and major renovations will be carbon-neutral by 2030.

â€œOur views of what the project should become over the course of the semester were very similar, making us a successful team right off the bat,â€ said Simon (L) in reference to his teammate (R). â€œIvan had a wide range of experience in graphic design, and was the only undergraduate in our studio, while I had experience in building construction. Both of us showed great building design skills in the beginning weeks of the studio through our models and graphics.â€ Simon credits Caine for recognizing their potential as teammates and pairing them up.

â€œTransform for Stormâ€ responds to the proposed site of Galveston, Texas, location of the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Before the Storm of 1900, Galveston was a bustling port city on the Gulf Coast and the center of cotton trade in Texas. When the storm hit land, it flooded the island and killed about one-fifth of the island population. Galveston would eventually rebuild the lost urban fabric and construct a ten-mile long and seventeen-foot-high seawall to protect the islandâ€™s southern exposure. It is on this seawall where the studentsâ€™ proposed eco-hotel sits.

The city never regained its position as a preeminent port of entry for the southern U.S., having to diversify its economy through tourism, health care, finance, and education. Despite Galvestonâ€™s physical recovery, the reality of life in Galveston continues to be defined by the precarious geography and fragile ecology of the barrier island. This project aspires to remember the past while confidently and creatively imagining the future, mediating Galvestonâ€™s environmental circumstances through efficiency, adaptability, and resilience. In designing this eco-hotel, Simon and Ventura aim to create an architecture that attends to the challenging humid, subtropical climate; weathers the increasingly severe storms that roll in from the Gulf; redefines the program, function, and image of twenty-first century leisure; achieves a powerful and refined architectural expression using limited material resources; and makes residents feel safe.

The AIA San Antonio Design Awards program recognizes outstanding built and un-built architectural projects by the local architectural profession and students to promote public interest and awareness in design excellence. Submitters were asked to highlight design solutions that have made, or could make, a positive impact on individuals and communities affected by the project and accomplish the goals of clients and users. They were judged on quality of design, resolution of the program or idea, innovation, thoughtfulness, and technique. Simon and Ventura were praised by the jury for their â€œprojectâ€™s sensitive exploration of how design can address the challenges of coastal habitation, offering hope for our shared future.â€

14212,Advanced Robotics to host first Sumobot competition,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>Nov. 18, 2019 â€” UTSAâ€™s Advanced Robotics student organization and the Engineering Student Council will host the first Sumobot competition with the aim of letting participants explore Arduino, an open-sourced electronic platform hardware and software, and have fun while practicing building simple robots. The robots will be composed of solely Arduino components and made of 3D printed parts or building materials supplied by Advanced Robotics.Â </p>
<p>The Sumobot competition will be predominantly directed by <strong>Bosco Madassery,</strong> the president of Advanced Robotics, and <strong>Kyle Fetter, </strong>the technical director of Advanced Robotics. Since this is the first time the competition will be conducted, it will be exclusive to the members of the Advanced Robotics organization this semester, with 13 teams competing.Â </p>
<p>The competition, scheduled for Friday, Nov. 22 from 3â€“7 p.m., will have teams consisting of up to three people each with a $15 registration fee per person. The competition is structured to coax participants to work in a team, as opposed to entering as individuals. More team members will give the robot a better chance of winning.Â </p>
<p>â€œWith the first $15 from a team or individual, we buy the parts necessary to build a Sumobot,â€ explained Madassery. â€œIf youâ€™re competing as an individual, then your budget is fully spent on the basic electronics. But if youâ€™re in a team, then you have the ability to spend an additional $15 to $30, based on the number of team members you have.â€Â </p>
<p>The teams may use the extra budget to upgrade their robots if they wish to do so. Any part of the budget that is not used will be added onto the first and second place cash prizes.Â </p>
<p>Each round of the competition will be won by making the opposing robot leave the fighting ring or by neutralizing the other robot in a nondestructive manner. The robots are allowed to display â€œnonlethalâ€ battle techniques, such as pushing, shoving and flipping.Â </p>
<p>â€œThe basic rule of the competition is to be the last sumobot standing,â€ stated Madassery.Â </p>
<p>Once the registration process for the competition is complete the teams are required to submit three documents. The documents include a preliminary design submission, a dritical design submission and the robotâ€™s user manual. The PDS document is a basic explanation of the robot along with the dimensions, fighting techniques, defensive techniques, and a list of materials needed to make the robot. The CDS document is an in-depth report of the robot with CAD renderings and further specifications. The robotâ€™s user manual should include all necessary information on the functions, including step-by-step instructions on the construction of the robot. The user manual is to be submitted before the competition with the robot for inspection.Â </p>
<p>â€œThe primary purpose of having the teams submit these documents is to give them experience on writing technical documents,â€ said Madassery.Â </p>
<p>Advanced Robotics also provided Arduino workshops every Monday to help any of the teams that were struggling with their robots. All participating Sumobot teams were encouraged to attend. Led by the workshop director, <strong>Mohammed Ahmed,</strong> executive assistant of Advanced Robotics, the workshops covered an in-depth look into the different components that are used in the robot, and the code necessary to operate the different electrical aspects. Currently, the curriculum for the Arduino workshops has been completed; however, Advanced Robotics is still providing open workshops in their lab (AET 1.202) on Fridays after 4 p.m. These open workshops allow Sumobot teams to build their robots with tools in the lab.</p>

14218,Program prepares students for future careers in nuclear security,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>Nov. 20, 2019 â€” UTSA is educating and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers to provide innovative solutions to the grand challenges in nuclear security.</p>
<p>Â A cross-disciplinary team of researchers led by faculty members in the College of Sciences and the College of Engineering have been awarded nearly $3 million in grant funding by the National Nuclear Security Administration for their project CONNECT (The CONsortium on Nuclear sECurity Technologies).</p>
<p>UTSA team members included <strong>Kelly Nash</strong> (PI), associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy; <strong>Miltos Alamaniotis</strong>, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; <strong>Amanda Fernandez</strong>, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science; <strong>Harry Millwater</strong>, the Samuel G. Dawson Endowed Professor of Mechanical Engineering; and <strong>Elizabeth Sooby W</strong><strong>ood</strong>, assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
<p>â€œCONNECT is an excellent example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, drawing on the strengths of talented faculty in both the College of Sciences and the College of Engineering,â€ explained <strong>David Silva</strong>, dean of UTSAâ€™s Colleges of Sciences. â€œWe are excited to support this important venture that will prepare students to make positive impacts in nuclear security.â€</p>
<p>â€œThis type of collaboration between sciences and engineering researchers is critical to making the next big discoveries in energy and security. UTSA researchers continue to provide these unique opportunities to our students in the lab but also in the classroom, so that they are prepared to engage across all disciplines in their careers,â€ added <strong>JoAnn Browning</strong>, dean of UTSAâ€™s College of Engineering.</p>
<p>The UTSA team is partnered with leaders in both student training and nuclear forensics science, including investigators at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (<strong>Frederic Poineau</strong>), St. Maryâ€™s University (<strong>Juan Ocampo</strong>), Argonne National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Nash and Wood explained that the consortium will conduct basic and applied research that utilizes experimental and computational technologies to create a pipeline of diverse students with strong backgrounds in nuclear science, fissionable fuels fabrication and processing, nuclear materials characterization, nuclear forensic signatures, nuclear technology, and data and visual analytics.</p>
<p>Students studying physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, among other disciplines, will work together on interdisciplinary research and network with experts in the nuclear security field.</p>
<p>â€œThe overall goal of the project is to connect students interested in STEM with national Department of Energy labs and top experts so they are prepared to enter the workforce and be leaders in careers pertaining to national nuclear security,â€ explained Nash, the principal investigator of the grant.</p>
<p>â€œCONNECT gives students the opportunity to explore topics, such as nuclear materials and nuclear security and they may never have considered these fields before. The project has both an educational and scientific impact as it introduces students to the various career opportunities available,â€ replied Wood.</p>
<p>The CONNECT consortium is part of the <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/nnsa-minority-serving-institution-partnership-program"">NNSA Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program.</a> which is designed to build a pipeline between the Department of Energy's sites and labs and minority-serving institutions in STEM disciplines and bring a heightened awareness of NNSA plants and laboratories to institutions with a common interest in STEM research fields. Currently MSIPP supports 10 consortium-based teams consisting of participants from select institutions.</p>
<p>â€œUTSA provides rich undergraduate experiential learning opportunities like this and itâ€™s especially important for undergraduates because it provides a pathway for them to acquire real-world research and career experiences,â€ said Nash.</p>
<p>During the three-year grant, 13 Ph.D. students and nearly 30 undergraduate students will be supported through the project.</p>
<p>Nash said that UTSA and its CONNECT partners will host undergraduates during the summer to introduce the students to research and career opportunities and to also provide mentorship.</p>

14220,UTSA engineering students build interactive exhibits to engage children at The DoSeum,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">
<p>Nov. 20, 2019 â€” Two teams of UTSA engineering students are building new interactive exhibits that will engage local children in the mysteries of sight and sound at The DoSeum. Their projects will be on display at the university this month along with the innovative work of 91 other student teams at the <a href=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/tech-symposium/"">UTSA College of Engineering Technology Symposium</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>â‡’ <em>The showcase, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2019 in the H-E-B Student Union Ballroom on the UTSA Main Campus.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The DoSeum projects are among five EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) that will be on display at the Tech Symposium, one of Texasâ€™ largest university engineering accelerators, a showcase of innovative projects developed by UTSA students in civil, computer, electrical and mechanical engineering. EPICS is a service-learning design program, where teams of students partner with local and global community organization to address human, community and environmental needs.</p>
<p>â€œI have found that EPICS replicates the real world while adding learning moments. When we consider future impacts on the community and our guests, I foresee these two UTSA EPICS exhibits as fundamental in showcasing the education pipeline for local kids who visit The DoSeum,â€ said <strong>Orlando Graves BolaÃ±os</strong>, Arts Education Manager at The DoSeum. â€œImagine a fifth grader interacting with a lesson on light and sound phenomena and then becoming aware that a local college student conceived, designed and fabricated that exhibit. Thatâ€™s a powerful and attainable message that spotlights near future next steps for a future in STEM.â€</p>
<p><em>Beyond the Eyes </em>and <em>Tuned In</em> are not only senior design projects but are also the inaugural projects of the UTSA EPICS program, which began in spring 2019 with a collaboration with The DoSeum. The exhibits will be housed in The DoSeumâ€™s Semmes Foundation Spy Academy. The DoSeum is a STEM-focused childrenâ€™s museum that introduces children of all ages to STEM-related activities through play and discovery.</p>
<p><em>Beyond the Eyes</em> uses infrared LEDs to place a programmable message hidden within the Spy Academy for child â€œspiesâ€ to discover. The children will use a camera that can see the infrared that is invisible to the naked eye to take part in the adventure.</p>
<p><em>Tuned In</em> involves challenges children to decode a sample wave form by varying the frequency, amplitude and phase of an oscilloscope-type waveform tracing. Students adjust the oscilloscope tracing to match the test waveform to the target.</p>
<p>Both projects will be deployed at The DoSeum over the next several months, initiating the cultivation of a long-term relationship that includes design, building and installation as well as evaluation that will allow UTSA to refine and support the projects over time. The UTSA EPICS program plans to continue working with The DoSeum after completion. More DoSeum exhibit designs will begin production at UTSA in the spring of 2020.</p>
<p>Three additional EPICS projects are currently under development in Senior Design I and will also be on display at the Tech Symposium. Two UTSA EPICS teams are currently working with the Salvation Army to develop an inventory and volunteer tracking system and a third is working with San Antonio Sports to create an app that will provide a paperless way for parents to enroll their children into the San Antonio Sports <em>i-Play! afterschool </em>program, as well as other tracking systems.</p>
<p>EPICS is a student-led, faculty-advised service learning effort that enhances the studentsâ€™ professional preparation and strengthens their multidisciplinary design skills. Each student team has a project manager and design lead. The EPICS experience runs over the course of the entire four years of a studentâ€™s undergraduate experience, allowing for project timelines to be realistic and continuing, involving the community in positive ways and providing opportunities for mentoring and leadership experiences.</p>
<p>â€œMy overall experience with EPICS has been tremendously rewarding,â€ says <strong>Helena Oxendine</strong>, a post-baccalaureate studying electrical engineering. â€œThis program continues to teach me valuable skills in business and professional communication, project planning and management, documentation and collaboration, customer relations, and data collection. Iâ€™ve been given the opportunity to lead and mentor a group of underclassmen and be a part of something bigger with a greater impact than a traditional senior design project. The striking aspects of EPICS is the ability to provide positive impacts throughout the San Antonio community through engineering.â€</p>
<p>The EPICS program originally began at Purdue University in the fall of 1995 as a multidisciplinary, team-based service learning experience. This unique program allows teams of undergraduate students to design, build and deploy real systems to solve engineering-based challenges for local community service and education organizations.</p>
<p>The program bridges the gap between community service organizations who need individuals with strong technical backgrounds and students who need solid expertise in their disciplines to succeed in the future. Through EPICS, undergraduate students work with people of many different backgrounds to identify and achieve shared goals. This experiential learning opportunity helps broaden the skillsets of UTSA students.</p>
<p>""EPICS provides a wonderful opportunity for students to experience the design process throughout their entire academic progression from their freshman year until they graduate, work on engineering solutions that will be put into practice, and experience the entire design process, all while experiencing a real, observable impact on our local community,â€ said <strong>August Allo</strong>, a Senior Lecturer in the UTSA Department Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>

14368,Researchers' nanodisk could restore function for Lou Gehrig's disease patients,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dec. 5, 2019</strong>Â â€” For decades the renowned English physicist Stephen Hawking lived with a motor neuron disease until his death last year. People who suffer from this condition lose functionality of brain cells that control essential muscle activity, such as speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing.Â </p>
<p>To help individuals afflicted by MNDs, UTSA has embarked on revolutionary research that uses magnetic nano-sized disks and magnetic fields to individually modulate functionality to crucial neurons. This research could open the door to reversal of degenerative conditions like Hawkingâ€™s to restore the quality of life for about 1 million adults across the globe.Â </p>
<p>â€œWhen you lose function of a muscle, you start physical therapy or exercisesâ€”in other words, a mechanical function to regain your muscles. However, in the case of motor neuronal diseases, the doctor doesnâ€™t tell you to stretch your brain. With these disks, we stretch the brain for you,â€ saidÂ <strong>Gabriela Romero Uribe,</strong>Â an assistant professor in UTSAâ€™s biomedical engineering and chemical engineering departments, who is spearheading the research.Â </p>
<p>The messages from nerve cells in the brain are transmitted to nerve cells in the brainâ€™s stem and spinal cord, and from them to particular muscles. However, when this pathway is damaged, options are limited to restore functionality.</p>
<p>Previous approaches to manipulate brain circuits have included electrical stimulation and optogeneticsâ€”the use of light to control ion channelsâ€”which may damage tissue. Moreover, manipulation via drug treatments is severely hampered by the blood-brain barrier, a layer of tissue that protects the brain from injury.Â </p>
<p>â€œThe blood-brain barrier is the biggest issue in pharmacology,â€ Romero said. â€œOnly about 3% of drugs administered goes into the brain. The rest enter other parts of the body and can damage organs.â€Â </p>
<p>Romeroâ€™s approach to use magnetic disks to generate mechanical force is unique. The additional benefit of this method is that itâ€™s nontoxic, drug-free and a minimally invasive procedure that leaves negligible to no damage to the body.Â </p>
<p>â€œOur bodies transmit magnetic fields, and we can also apply magnetic fields all over the body,â€ said Romero. â€œWe have learned that magnetic nanoparticles can receive magnetic fields and translate them into signals that neurons can understand.â€Â </p>
<p>The nano-sized disks studied at UTSA then absorb magnetic fields and provide torque to stimulate motor neurons to act.Â </p>
<p>In motor neuron disease, such as Parkinsonâ€™s, neurons stop producing dopamine. Romero envisions using the nanoparticles and magnetic fields to start stimulating the neurons to produce dopamine again. Currently, sheâ€™s in collaboration with colleagues in Spain to fabricate the wireless disks in large quantities. Those magnetic materials will include gold and titanium.Â </p>
<p>Experts believe that nine in 10 cases of MND occur by chance. The exact causes are unclear, but the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke says that toxic, viral and environmental factors may also play a role.Â </p>
<p>The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, reported that about 926,000 people worldwide suffered from one of these types of diseases in 2016, with about 34,000 ending in death each year.Â </p>
<p>Romero recently received a $1M grant from the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s National Institute of General Medical Sciences to fund the next phase of the project. The work was first developed with a seed fund made possible byÂ <a href=""http://research.utsa.edu/texas-university-research/utsa-research/research-support-officer/"">UTSAs Office for Research Support</a>, part of the Office of the Vice President for Research, Economic Development and Knowledge Enterprise, which fosters collaborative research focused on the worldâ€™s most pressing health challenges.</p>

14389,Staff Spotlight: Monica Casanova,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica Casanova</strong> is an Administrative Associate I for the College of Engineeringâ€™s Development Office.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><br />I was born and raised in Michigan â€“ Go Blue! My husband and I recently celebrated our 19<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary and we have three children together: 18-year-old Gabe, 11-year-old Maya, and 6-year-old Elena. In Michigan, I worked at The University of Michigan for 13 years, working my way up from a file clerk to the Program Director of the Alumni Student Recruitment Program. In 2015 my family and I made the toughest decision of our lives and relocated to Southern California due to a job promotion my husband received. There were not many college campuses near our residence in California, so I found a job at a local charter school in the guidance department. We made many great friends and enjoyed great experiences in California, but were missing the family connection that my husband and I grew up with. In 2018Â Â  we decided to move to San Antonio where we have many friends and extended family members. With so many college campuses in San Antonio and missing the university atmosphere, I began a job hunt within higher education. I am celebrating my 1-year anniversary with UTSA this month!</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><br />I am the Administrative Associate I for the Development Office at the College of Engineering. I support the Engineering Development Office with stewardship, cultivation, and special events.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best thing about your job?</strong><br />I enjoy the fact that every day is different and fun.</p>
<p><strong>What is your proudest moment with the COE?</strong><br />My proudest moment within the COE would be when I participated in the planning of the Large-Scale Testing Laboratory Grand Opening, which occurred in October, and seeing the event come together so well.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite thing about San Antonio?</strong><br />One of the things that drew us to San Antonio is the music; we love Tejano music! I also love that San Antonio is so divers and culturally based.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite quote?</strong><br />Live Laugh Love</p>
<p><strong>How do you like to spend your free time?</strong><br />I enjoy spending time with my family lounging at home, attending one of the many events that San Antonio has to offer, and catching a run or workout when I can.</p>
<p><strong>If you were an animal, what would you be?</strong><br />I would probably be some type of bird so I could see the earth in a different perspective.</p>

14391,Faculty Spotlight - Lyle Hood,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lyle Hood</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the College of Engineeringâ€™s Mechanical Engineering Department.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><br />Iâ€™m a native Texan originally from the Corpus Christi area. I went to the University of Houston for my bachelorâ€™s degree, Virginia Tech/Wake Forest (joint program) for my MS and PhD, and Houston Methodist Research Institute as a postdoc.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><br />I am an Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department, but I also work within the Biomedical, Electrical, and Computer Engineering Departments. I teach classes, conduct research on medical device development, and undertake service activities on behalf of UTSA and the greater community. <br /><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><br />I wanted to join an up and coming university. University of Houston was in a similar push to Tier I status when I attended in the 2000s, and also shares UTSAâ€™s diverse student body and big city campus. I feel at home here and am happy to be part of a public university so focused on community service and impact.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your research and what led you to your field.</strong><br />I was raised with a focus on clinical care in a family of many medical professionals, but my talents and passion were more directed at technologies that enable that care. That is reflected in the research program and laboratory community I started here at UTSA (shout out to the Medical Design Innovations Lab!), which is dedicated to developing innovative medical devices, with particular emphasis on treating cancer, military medicine, and airway management in emergency trauma situations.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want the public to know about your research? Why is your topic important?</strong><br />I am fortunate to be working in a field whose importance is readily understood. Cancer is terrible and tragic. Our soldiers need medical care, both for our own wounded and to offer others they are protecting abroad. For airway management, one of the American Lungâ€™s Associationâ€™s mottos say it best: â€œIf you canâ€™t breathe, nothing else matters.â€ The MDI Lab and I are privileged to work closely with brilliant medical doctors at leading institutions like UT Health SA and the Institute for Surgical Research to develop innovative, practical technologies to arm them for the complex patient issues they face daily.</p>
<p><strong>What projects are you working on now?</strong><br />I am fortunate to be working on several fascinating (at least to us), high-impact potential projects. A few highlights include an improved limb and organ transport system for keeping transplantable tissues alive longer, innovative methods for pancreatic cancer treatment and cancer immunotherapy, and compact but powerful design improvements to medical devices used by first responders.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of your job?</strong><br />Watching my students succeed. I have only been here a few years, but I have had the privilege of watching my students win competitions, start companies, and transition to high impact jobs around the country. My first PhD student, Dr. Corinne Nawn, finished her dissertation this year and took a consulting job in Boston. Robert Brothers started a position at the Naval Medical Research Unit here in San Antonio, and Andrea Afanador is using her UTSA-learned mechanical engineering skills working for UPS in the Midwest. These students are powerhouses that would have succeeded without input from me, but being able to contribute to their careers and see them reach their goals is my favorite part.</p>
<p><strong>What book are you currently reading (or read last)?</strong><br />Iâ€™m a big fan of fiction. Iâ€™m currently finishing The Well of Ascension by Brandon Sanderson, which is book two in one of my favorite series. I recommend the books to my girlfriend, who started listening to the audiobook around me, which made me re-read all of them. We recently finished the Dresden Files, which are also amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Describe what you were like at age 10.</strong><br />I called in to consult on this one. I have it on parental authority that I was mostly an annoying ball of energy. Very competitive. Into baseball and basketball, wanted to be a fighter pilot, and read a lot. Pretty normal overall.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else in your life that youâ€™d like to share?</strong><br />I havenâ€™t checked in many years, but I used to hold the record for consecutive time juggling back at my high school. A â€œfriendâ€ clapped in my face after 20-30 minutes and made me drop one.</p>

14438,Following a passion for math and problem solving at UTSA,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p>Dec. 30, 2019 â€” When the time came forÂ <strong>Argali Moctezuma</strong>Â to graduate from Northside ISDâ€™s Brandeis High School, she knew she wanted math and problem solving to be a part of her future.Â </p>
<p>â€œIâ€™m from Mexico and English is my second language, so math has always been easier for me because itâ€™s the same language,â€ Moctezuma said.Â </p>
<p>This is why the first-generation college student just recently completed her undergraduate degree, earning her bachelor of science in electrical engineering.Â </p>
<p>Originally from Puebla, Mexico, Moctezuma and her mother moved when she was a child to California, where she attended a bilingual elementary school and had to learn a new language. Shortly afterward, they moved to Texas for Moctezumaâ€™s middle school years.Â </p>
<p>While things werenâ€™t easy for the mother and daughter growing up, Moctezuma said the idea to pursue higher education was inspired by her mom.Â </p>
<p>â€œMy mom was a hardworking single mother for a long time while raising me,â€ she said. â€œThe whole transition moving from Mexico and coming to the United States was a lot for us. She always encouraged me to go to school and do my best.â€Â </p>
<p>At UTSA, Moctezuma was a member of the Society of Women Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi, and Eta Kappa Nu, a computer and electrical engineering honor society.Â </p>
<p>She also was the recipient of the E. Eugene Carter Scholarship, a College of Engineering tutor and served as a college ambassador. Being a college ambassador led her involvement in community outreach, volunteering at on-campus events and working with high school robotics teams.Â </p>
<p>Getting the youth involved and inspired by the STEM field is something Moctezuma has worked on doing since attending UTSA.Â </p>
<p>Together with a group of her colleagues, Moctezuma helped construct an exhibit for The DoSeum using skills they learned in their engineering courses.Â </p>
<p>Their project, â€œTuned In, Tuned In,â€ is an interactive exhibit that will teach children about the science of sound waves while completing challenges to become a master spy. It will be installed at the childrenâ€™s interactive museum in 2020.Â </p>
<p>The project is a part of the College of Engineeringâ€™s EPICS program. EPICS allows students from all academic levels to form multiyear, multidisciplinary teams that partner with the San Antonio community in experiential service-learning projects.Â </p>
<p>â€œIt was really exciting to get that experience and present our ideas to The DoSeum staff,â€ Moctezuma said. â€œWe did several prototypes and took feedback to improve our project.â€Â </p>
<p>Encouraging young people, especially young girls, is important to her, Moctezuma said.Â </p>
<p>One moment that really stuck out to her was when a female high school student came up to her and was inspired by Moctezumaâ€™s story after hearing her speak on a women in STEM panel.Â </p>
<p>In the new year Moctezuma will begin working full-time at Freese and Nichols, where she interned working on their water and wastewater electrical design. Freese and Nichols is a consulting firm that offers services in engineering, architecture, environmental science, planning, construction science and program management.</p>

<p><strong>Mehdi Shadaram</strong> is the Interim Chair for the COE Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the Briscoe Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><br />After finishing my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I immigrated to the US in 1977 in order to continue my education. After receiving my Ph.D. in 1984, I was hired by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) as a tenure track assistant professor. Eventually, I became an endowed professor and department chair at UTEP. I came to UTSA in 2003 as a distinguished professor and chair of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Since 2007, I have served in different positions as associate dean, center director, and interim dean. Currently, I serve as the interim chair of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><br />Briscoe Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Interim Chair of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><br />The rapid growth of UTSA.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your research and what led you to your field.</strong><br />My main area of research activity is in the broadband analog and digital fiber optics and wireless communications systems. My involvement in this field ranges from analog and digital photonic devices and fiber optic links to fiber optic sensors. I became interested in this field while I was an undergraduate student in the mid-seventies, when fiber optic systems were being introduced into the market. The idea of photons carrying information for hundreds of kilometers was very fascinating to me. In addition, I have been involved with different aspects of engineering education since I undertook administrative duties.</p>
<p><strong>Were you a first generation or low-income college student?</strong><br />I was both. My parents did not finish high school. I had six siblings and my mother, a homemaker, had a full-time job taking care of domestic chores. My father had to work six days a week to provide financial support.</p>
<p><strong>If so, what was that like for you? For example, did your family encourage getting a higher degree?</strong><br />My family was always very supportive. My father particularly encouraged us to continue our education to the highest level.</p>
<p><strong>Did you always feel like you would be able to get into or â€œmake itâ€ in college?</strong><br />Going to college, particularly in the engineering field, was very competitive when I was young. I knew from an early age that I had to work hard in order to pass the entrance exam to college. When I entered the college, my professors were my role models. I tried to follow their footsteps and I was also very hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have a good support system in college? How did you overcome any obstacles that may have prevented you from obtaining your Ph.D.?<br /></strong>I have been lucky that I was able to go to college full-time throughout. My undergraduate education was almost free of charge. During my graduate education, I received support such as teaching and research assistantships and some support from family. Also, I had very supportive and helpful faculty advisors. My advisor was very instrumental in securing an internship position for me during my Ph.D. education.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite part of your job?</strong><br />Interacting with students, collaborating with my colleagues, and having the freedom to explore new technological areas that are related to my interest.</p>
<p><strong>How do you define success?</strong><br />I use the quote from Maya Angelou to define success: â€œSuccess is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.â€</p>
<p><strong>If you could eat only one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?<br /></strong>Baked Panzerotti.</p>

14470,Researchers collaborate to improve urban infrastructure resilience,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p>JANUARY 23, 2020Â â€” Data shows that 82% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, and it is projected that the percentage will increase to 90% by 2050. The size of the populations in urban centers is creating demands that overwhelm the capacity of infrastructures, particularly in times of distress.Â </p>
<p>Researchers at UTSA are working to remedy this problem. Through a $100,000 planning grant from the National Science Foundation, a team of researchers with expertise in engineering, computing, infrastructures, cyber-physical systems, political science, public policy and STEM education is leading the creation of the Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities.Â </p>
<p>The Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities will develop transforming technologies for one of the most important societal problems we currently face: engineering critical infrastructures of large population centers to achieve sustainable growth while improving equity and well-being of residents.</p>
<p>To achieve this mission, the center will develop the underlying science for a distributed sensor and data science framework to assist authorities and the private sector as they make decisions that yield the most benefit to urban residents.Â </p>
<p>The center will enable research and technology to improve urban infrastructure resilience. The proposed research will support superior real-time data processing, storage and dissemination to accelerate processing of large data sets in digital communities. Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence experts will advance fundamental knowledge in their collective domains. Computing researchers will have access to the complete data flow chain and be able to study networking weaknesses against cyberattacks.Â </p>
<p>The networking will include narrowband and broadband wireless and wired data communication, networking with traditional and emerging sensor cloud environments, and various interfaces.Â </p>
<p>Researchers will develop critical infrastructure management and health informatics applications capable of exploring interdependences between these domains. Infrastructure researchers will leverage these advances to study efficiency and resilience of urban infrastructures during normal operating conditions and during different types of disruptions, such as hurricanes, floods and chemical spills using real-time data.Â </p>
<p>â€œUTSA is uniquely positioned to lead research advances in this area through an existing foundation of strategic initiatives and research centers on sustainability, climate science, water resources, data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and energy,â€ saidÂ <strong>Adolfo Matamoros,</strong>Â a Peter T. Flawn Distinguished Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at UTSA. â€œThese strategic initiatives have been developed in close collaboration with partners from industry, the City of San Antonio, federal agencies, research institutes and the U.S. military. The Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities will build on this foundation to advance smart city science and technology development and expand to include workforce development.â€Â </p>
<p>Through this planning grant, a diverse group of stakeholders will join forces to develop consensus on advances in science and engineering needed to achieve sustainable growth of urban ecosystems through convergent research. The outcomes of the planning will provide a roadmap to guide future research efforts and foster new collaboration not previously considered.Â </p>
<p>Two stakeholder workshops will be held to develop a vision, goals and research plan that reflect the concerns and priorities of the San Antonio community. The first will be held on Friday, Jan. 24 from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the John Peace Library, Faculty Center (JPL 4.04.16) on the Main Campus. A second stakeholder workshop will be held in April.</p>

14504,Faculty Spotlight: Nehal Abu-Lail,"<!-- wp:tadv/classic-paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nehal Abu-Lail </strong>is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong><strong><br /></strong>I am a female from Nazareth, Palestine, the eldest of six siblings, five girls all of whom are engineers and a boy who is an applied mathematician. My father was an Arabic teacher and my mom is a math teacher. I am married to a physical anthropologist. I came to the US in 2000 to get my PhD and stayed here since then. I call Boston home since it is the first city I landed in in the US.</p>
<p><strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong><strong><br /></strong>I am an associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. As a faculty member, my job entails performing research, securing funding, mentoring students, publishing papers, teaching and serving the department, college, university, scientific community, and the public.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong><strong><br /></strong>I moved my lab from Washington State University to UTSA for four main reasons. First, I was very interested in contributing to the development of the Chemical Engineering (CME) program. CME is the newest addition to the College of Engineering and I felt that I can put my signature on how it is designed. Second, our department has a research focus in the field of tissue engineering, which is a main research thrust for my group. Collaborating with my colleagues is important to enhancing my research program in interesting and unique ways. Third, I love San Antonio. Fourth, I became closer to family.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your research and what led you to your field.</strong><strong><br /></strong>My lab focuses on fundamental investigations of cellular properties and cellular interactions with surfaces under stressful environments. We are interested largely in applications of bacterial biofilms in medical and environmental domains as well as in articular cartilage tissue engineering. <br />I became interested in this field as soon as I came to the US. My advisor was newly hired and was working on the new research area of nanoscale investigations of bacterial cells. In 2000, very few labs in the nation did similar research to what she did. It was innovative, unique and truly interesting. It still is. In my opinion, nothing beats the excitement of manipulating single molecules and single cells.</p>
<p><strong>What got you into engineering? What is your first memory associated with engineering?<br /></strong>To answer the first part, I think three things. First, engineering is prestigious in the Middle East. All parents dream for their kids to be engineers or doctors. Second, it pays well. My salary as a starting engineer was higher than the salaries of both my parents combined after 30 years of teaching experiences. Third, the love of math. <br />As for the second part, I have countless memories associated with engineering. One that stands out is how different the size of a valve I saw when I interned in a petroleum refinery from what I pictured in mind. That was revealing.</p>
<p><strong>What projects are you working on now?<br /></strong>We are working on several projects at the moment. Three PhD students in the lab are investigating variable aspects of tissue engineering of articular cartilage. One MS student is investigating how bacterial infections affect diabetic wounds using a skin tissue engineered model. Furthermore, one MS student is investigating how biochar can be utilized in sand to attenuate the transport of bacterial pathogens in the sub-surface. Finally, I am exploring why women are minorities in engineering in the US while they are a majority in predominantly Muslim countries.</p>
<p><strong>How do you define success?<br /></strong>I set criteria for myself that pushes me out of my comfort zone. When I accomplish that, I increase the bar more. I continue to develop myself to achieve more. Overall, I want to be an excellent teacher, researcher and servant who continues to learn and to excel with time. In academia, we have known measures for each of the categories above and I always try to exceed what is accepted as the norm by most of my colleagues in each category.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite thing about San Antonio?<br /></strong>Many things but I have to pick one then that will be the diversity of the birds and wild flowers in the city. Â </p>

15537,A new 50-year vision for San Antonio's downtown,"<div>
<h3><img src=""http://cacp.utsa.edu/images/uploads/thumbnail_DSC00067_Group_Studio_c.jpg"" alt="""" /></h3>
<h3><strong>The studio project</strong></h3>
While UTSA just celebrated its 50th year and the Downtown Campus is approaching 25 years in existence, aÂ  collaborative studio of the UTSA Department of Architecture and Sun Moon University students are asked to question the existence of the portion of freeway separating the UTSA Downtown Campus from the rest of San Antonioâ€™s urban core. They are proposing solutions for fostering connection, enhancing public space, and reintegrating the near West Side community back into downtown. The studio is being led by Lecturer Candid Rogers with assistance from Professors Dr. Heewon Lee and Ki Suk Lee.

How could a portion of I-10 be removed or reconfigured to ameliorate its divisive effect? How can induced demand reinforce a new vision? How can traffic flow be reconsidered to minimize congestion and pollution? What new space can be gained by reimaging the freeway and its environs? What strategic policies are necessary to support renewal? What solutions can be gleaned from examples of smart growth and transit-oriented development that have been successfully implemented elsewhere?
<h3><strong>The collaboration with Sun Moon University</strong></h3>
This is the first collaborative studio of the UTSA Department of Architecture and Sun Moon University, called IDEAS (International Design Exchange Architecture Studio) Workshop. Our guests are joining UTSA Lecturer Candid Rogersâ€™ regular class doing their Global Capstone Design program for 2 weeks. The Korean students are well-trained according to KAAB (Korea Architectural Accrediting Board) criteria. Though it is a very short time to produce a detailed concrete plan, a mixed team of American and Korean students resulted in a well-blended idea of Eastern and Western styles from the perspectives of urban revitalization and regeneration, which gave a many inspirational ideas for future downtown of San Antonio.
<h3><strong>The studio invites all to attend the IDEAS Workshop final review on Friday, January 31 </strong></h3>
<strong>What: </strong>Review the conceptual master plan of the project. Students will prepare their schematic ideas in powerpoint format.

<strong>When: </strong>1-5pm Friday, January 31

<strong>Where: </strong>Monterey Bldg. Gallery (MNT 1.108)

<strong>Critics:Â  </strong>Studio Professor Candid Rogers, UTSA Lecturer; 2 Korean Professors, Dr. Heewon Lee and Ki Suk Lee; 2 Korean Practicing Architects, Wongi Hong and Kwang Hyoo Choi; Dr. Sedef Doganer; Dr. Greg P. Griffin; Dr. Albert Han; Dr. Jae Yong Suk; Joshua Gerkin
<h3><strong>Teams</strong></h3>
<strong>Team 1</strong>
Nickname: Green Avenue
Students: Su Yeon Kang, Jason Ji-Won Brandner, John Franklin, Diego Mojica
Theme: San Antonio Highway Renewal

Enhancing the pedestrian experience for the community by reclaiming lost and abandoned areas underneath the I-10/I-35 highway. With public intervention, we hope to connect neglected downtown San Antonio by creating a confluence of green spaces, art, culture, and recreational facilities.

Nickname: Sun Lunna
Students: Jihye Kang, Ahyoung Oh, Nara Lee, Josiah Barrios, Emma Duncan

Reprogramming the city blocks between downtown San Antonio and UTSAâ€™s downtown campus to integrate community engagement and to redraw the urban fabric that was bisected by the I-10 / I-35 interstate exchange.

We do this by connecting the reprogrammed â€œblocksâ€ under the interstate into a series of architectural interventions tied together by a newly envisioned linear park.

A newly proposed high-speed vehicular tunnel would connect traffic exchange to avoid congestion downtown allowing for unique and community-oriented nodules to spring up around a more pedestrian-oriented downtown.

<strong>Team 3</strong>
Nickname: Crazy Long Hair
Students: Goeun Kim, Jeongmin Kim, Christian Dittmer, Victoria Gonzalez, Samuel Gonzalez
Theme: Mile Park

Mile Park is a community space that erases the barrier between downtown and the West Side by utilizing interstitial space with minimal intervention.

Through accessibility, playtime, cultural expression, university connections, and expansive green space, mile park creates a series of flowing experiences that strive for an interconnected San Antonio.

&nbsp;

<strong>Team 4</strong>
Nickname: Festa (Chuk Jye)
Students: So Yun Munn, Changhee Jung, Elizabeth Martinez, Dana Martinez
Theme: Connect+

Our goal for the proposed master plan is to connect the existing UTSA downtown campus to the new campus.

Also, the existing I-10 / I-35 highway creates a noisy and uninviting environment for UTSA, residents, and visitors.

The plan is to build this highway underground to reinvent the existing freeway and its underpass.

This includes having a program for the new underpass that will engage the students and the surrounding community.

Additionally, the existing downtown campus will be directly connected to the new campus with proposed pedestrian promenades on Dolorosa and Nueva street.

<img src=""http://cacp.utsa.edu/images/uploads/oooTeam4_c.jpg"" alt="""" />

<strong>Team 5</strong>
Nickname: Soochaehwah
Students: Chan Hee Jung, Jaeyoung Choi, Madison Stout, Kelsey Brown, Eva Martinez

Utilize existing structures to provide spaces for wellness and community engagement, with a focus on sustainable technologies and green spaces.

Through these spaces and improving pedestrian usage of the area through the bike and walking lanes, our goal is to foster connections between the near West Side and downtown communities.

<img src=""http://cacp.utsa.edu/images/uploads/oooTeam5_03_c.jpg"" alt="""" />

<strong>Team 6</strong>
Nickname: Layers
Students: Eunbi Kim, Hyeran Lim, Elizabeth Salazar, Guadalupe Estrada, Gabriel Balderrama

Taking inspiration from modern Korean cities, the proposed development redirects a portion of I-10 and I-35 underground, adding housing, businesses, and social green spaces to the recycled freeway structure.

By encouraging travel via public transportation, walking, and biking, a number of issues are addressed, including traffic congestion, crime, pollution, and urban decay.

Our design aims to analyze and challenge traditional American transportation infrastructure to prepare for a growing population and sustainable future.

15544,"UTSA CACP Speaker Series March 2 with Alex Krieger, FAIA of the Harvard GSD and NBBJ","<div>

(February 24, 2020) -- The UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning (CACP) 2019-2020 Speaker Series continues with Alex Krieger, FAIA, a Professor at the Harvard GSD and a Principal at global architecture and planning firm NBBJ, which focuses primarily on educational, institutional, healthcare, and public projects in complex urban settings. His talk, â€œCity on a Hill: Urban Idealism in America from the Puritans to the Present,â€ sponsored by Lucifer Lighting and presented in conjunction with AIA San Antonio, is free and open to the public and will be held at 6 p.m. Monday, March 2 in the McNay Art Museumâ€™s Chiego Lecture Hall.

Mr. Krieger has combined a career of teaching and practice, dedicating himself in both to improving the quality of place and life in our major urban areas. Bringing 40 years of experience, he has served a broad array of clients in numerous cities worldwide. He frequently advises mayors and their planning staff, and serves on a number of boards and commissions, including the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.

One of Americaâ€™s leading urban planners and scholars, Mr. Krieger is published widely on American urbanization, including his most recent book, <em>City on a Hill: Urban Idealism in America from the Puritans to the Present</em>, a sweeping history of American cities and towns and the utopian aspirations that shaped them. As he argues in the compelling and richly illustrated narrative, any attempt at deep understanding of how the country has developed must recognize the persistent and dramatic consequences of utopian dreaming. Even as ideals have changed, idealism itself has for better and worse shaped our world of bricks and mortar, macadam, parks, and farmland. Mr. Krieger delivers a striking new history of our built environment as he traces this uniquely American story from the Pilgrims to the â€œsmart cityâ€. In response to the underlying anti-urban bias historically pinned to American culture, he reminds us that utopian dreams once galvanized city planning in this country and looks toward the future by challenging us to imagine new utopias.

Mr. Krieger is Interim Chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design at the Harvard GSD, where he has taught since 1977. He previously served as Chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design (1998-2004 and 2006-2007), as Director of the Urban Design Program (1990-2001), and as Associate Chair of the Department of Architecture (1984-1989). In addition to design studios and seminar courses at the GSD, he teaches a general education class on the evolution of American cities, for which enrollment has been as high as 400 students. In 2003, 2005, and 2007 he was honored as one of the outstanding teachers at Harvard University. In 2007, <em>Design Intelligence Magazine</em>â€™s annual national survey named him one of seven â€œArchitectural Educators of the Year.â€ Mr. Krieger received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University and a Master of City Planning in Urban Design degree from Harvard. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

<em>Mr. Krieger will sign copies of his book, </em>City on a Hill: Urban Idealism in America from the Puritans to the Present<em>, immediately following the lecture. Attendees are encouraged to purchase books prior to the event through the following online outlets and bring their books to be signed at the lecture.Â  </em>

14684,Faculty Spotlight: Christopher Rathbone,"<strong>Christopher Rathbone, Ph.D.</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.

<strong>Please tell us about yourself.
</strong>I am originally from Iowa, the youngest of three siblings, the husband of an extremely supportive wife, and the proud father of two amazing kids.

<strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. I teach classes in the Spring and Fall semesters, supervise undergraduate and graduate students in research throughout the year, work towards procuring money to support my research, and provide service to UTSA by participating in a number of committees.

<strong>What brought you to UTSA?</strong>
I knew that the Department of Biomedical Engineering would provide me with the opportunities and support to succeed and provide meaningful scientific contributions. I also knew that I would have the opportunity to positively affect the next generation of students. This is important to me because Iâ€™ve been lucky to have had excellent teachers and mentors throughout the years.

<strong>Tell us about your research and what led you to your field.</strong>
My current research is focused on using tissue engineering strategies to develop skeletal muscle models that can recapitulate the negative effects of diseases like Type 2 diabetes. We also utilize tissue engineering-based approaches to develop therapies to treat diseases and injuries that can occur as a result of trauma. Iâ€™ve always had an interest in the amazing capacity of tissues, especially skeletal muscle, to remodel and repair. The fact that this capacity is altered with disease provides an endless supply of questions.

<strong>What do you want the public to know about your research? Why is your topic important?
</strong>The effect of traumatic injuries on muscle function are fairly obvious, but itâ€™s less well-known that many diseases disrupt skeletal muscle homeostasis in some way. Better understanding the effects of injury and disease on skeletal muscle through tissue engineering can provide us with a way to improve the development of therapies to treat these complications. Thereâ€™s also a strong possibility that tissue-engineered skeletal muscle may provide a means to directly repair damaged and diseased tissue. This is important because there are a large number of individuals that are affected by diseases like Type 2 diabetes and/or that have been injured.

<strong>What is your favorite part of your job?</strong>
There are a number of things I like about my job so nailing it down to one part if difficult, however, a thought that sticks out is that every day is different. Every day has unique challenges to overcome that require a specific approach, but also have small victories scattered throughout the day that continue to provide motivation.

<strong>Who has influenced you the most in life?</strong>
This is another tough question, and my perception of who has influenced me the most can really depend on what a given day puts in front of me (see previous answer). That caveat aside I have to say that my parents provided the greatest influence. It wasnâ€™t by the words they said, but in the way they demonstrated such strong character and humility every single day regardless of their circumstances, without exception.

<strong>What is your favorite quote?</strong>
There are a lot of quotes I like, but a lot of people that know me will know the answer is this one: â€œThe way you do one thing is the way you do everything.â€ Iâ€™m not sure exactly who to give the credit to. I mustâ€™ve heard it about 10 years ago and it just stuck.",,1582830942,2/27/20 19:15,https://ceid.utsa.edu/faculty-spotlight-christopher-rathbone/,post,UTSA COE,,faculty-spotlight-christopher-rathbone,0,0,publish,
14686,Staff Spotlight: Maria Alvarez,"<strong>Maria Alvarez</strong> is a Business Service Center Specialist II in the College of Engineering Business Service Center.

<strong>Please tell us about yourself.
</strong>I have proudly served UTSA for 21 years. My first 11 years of service were in Business Affairs. I started in the Disbursements Office, then promoted several times while working in the Budget Office/DEFINE System. I was eager to learn more, so I figured Academic Affairs would be a good move. I transferred to the College of Engineering Dean's Office in 2009, with a promotion to Management Analyst. In November 2018, my position was realigned, but I still have the pleasure of serving the College of Engineering in the Business Service Center.
I was born in Brownsville, Texas, but did not grow up there - I lived the life of a ""military brat."" I was fortunate to have traveled to and lived across the United States while my father was active duty in the Air Force. Our family never had the opportunity to travel with my dad overseas though, so that was my dream.
In order to travel overseas, I decided to follow in my father's footsteps, so I joined the United States Air Force and was active duty from 1989 to 1994. While enlisted, I obtained a Top Secret Clearance for my job as a Morse Code Interceptor Specialist, and my last couple of years as a Financial Analyst. While stationed in the United Kingdom, I gave birth to my two daughters, Andrea (going on 29 years old) and Rayanna (27 years old). They are my everything and I am so proud of them. I returned to the United States and then met Oscar - we recently celebrated our 20th anniversary. We enjoy going to concerts and traveling. Our favorite place to visit is Denver, Colorado. We catch up with friends, go to Denver Broncos football games, and go to the mountains at Black Hawk for a little gambling. In my spare time, I enjoy painting, making puzzles, hand crafting flowers, and crafting in general.

<strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong>
I am a Business Service Center Specialist II and I provide outstanding customer service to COE students, faculty, and staff in regards to human resources, payroll, and financial matters.

<strong>What is the best thing about your job?</strong>
I truly enjoy meeting new students each semester and helping them with any questions they may have. It's great to see them succeed each semester and see them graduate. I have also had the pleasure of working with great faculty and staff. I enjoy learning and growing with the changes and challenges at UTSA, so I am able to continue to grow in my position.

<strong>Before working at UTSA, what was the most unusual or interesting job you've ever had?
</strong>While at Lackland Air Force Base Basic Training, I had the honor of being selected in the Air Force Intelligence Agency. I trained to become a Morse Code Interceptor Specialist. The cryptology course took 21 weeks to learn. After graduation, the Air Force assigned me Royal Air Force Chicksands in the United Kingdom for a three-year long overseas tour. I served in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm, also referred to as the Gulf War, during that time.

<strong>How do you define success?Â </strong>
Not by the title one holds, but for being known for hard work, honesty, and willingness to share knowledge.

<strong>If you could travel anywhere, where would you go?</strong>
Spain.

<strong>Fill in the blank: I once met ____.
</strong>I once met Eric Clapton in the early 2000's. He is such a nice person.

<strong>What are your top three life highlights?</strong>
1. The births of my two beautiful daughters, Andrea and Rayanna.
2. Being one of five selected from all 1989 Lackland AFB Basic Training Graduating Class to attend the U.S. Army Intelligence School in Fort Devans, MA.
3. While on Military Leave, I was about to go back home to Texas and spend time with my family, especially my Grandmother Josephina. I will never forget the huge smile on her face when she saw me in formal blues uniform. She was such a blessing. ""Vaya con Dios,"" (Go with God) she always said. I did not know this would be my last wonderful memory of her.",,1582837760,2/27/20 21:09,https://ceid.utsa.edu/staff-spotlight-maria-alvarez/,post,UTSA COE,,staff-spotlight-maria-alvarez,0,0,publish,

14756,Staff Spotlight: Carlos Velez,"<strong>Carlos Velez</strong>Â is the Diversity and Outreach Program Coordinator for the College of Engineering Student Success Center.

<strong>Please tell us about</strong> <strong>yourself.</strong>
I was born and raised here in San Antonio. I'm a second generation American, with my parents' families coming from Mexico and Puerto Rico. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Biology and a Master of Education in Higher Education Administration. I have worked in higher education since 2011, having worked in Admissions, Financial Aid, Academic Advising, and Career Services.

<strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong>
I and the Diversity and Outreach Program Coordinator for the Student Success Center. My role is to help support under-represented students within the College of Engineering. I like to categorize my role into two areas: improving the student experience and improving student support. Currently, I am trying to assess students' experiences to use as a guide for how we can improve.

<strong>What is the best thing aboutÂ your job?</strong>
The best think about my work is getting to help set the foundation for these efforts. Diversity, equity, and inclusivity have gained a large focus among college campuses and industries across the country. Being on the front end of this and getting to find new ways to support historically marginalized groups is really exciting to be a part of.

<strong>What is yourÂ proudest moment working with the COE?</strong>
I have only been working here with the COE since December, so I don't have a specific moment that stands out yet. What has made me most proud throughout my time here has been the dedication and accomplishments of our students.

It has been great seeing the commitment our students have for learning and preparing for their future, both inside and outside of the classroom.

<strong>How do you define success?</strong>
I am the type of person who likes to consistently take on new challenges. When my goals are accomplished, I seek further ways to improve and grow. Since this can make it difficult to fully achieve everything I set out for, I view success through progress. When I make steps to learn or improve through my work, then I view that as success. This definition also helps success feel more tangible and accommodates for times when learning or growth comes from setbacks or challenges.

<strong>Who was your most important mentor and why?</strong>
My most important mentor is my father. My father was always a guiding light for me throughout my life. He showed me how much the perspective and attitude I bring towards life events can drastically shape the outcomes. No matter the situation, he always had a great attitude, was able to find ways to push forward and instill hope in those around him.

<strong>If you could travel anywhere, where would you go?
</strong>My travel is mostly dictated by food. With that in mind, I would really like to travel to Japan. I have been on a big sushi craze, so getting to try some of the best sushi in the world would be amazing. Japan also has such a rich culture that is so different from here in the U.S. So, getting to experience that between meals would be a great compliment to the trip.

<strong>Any random facts that you'd like to share about yourself?</strong>
I am an absolute cat lover. I have two kitties, Luke Skywalker and Black Kitty, who I adore. I have a soft spot for pets and always welcome people to show me pictures or videos of theirs.",,1585854987,4/2/20 19:16,https://ceid.utsa.edu/staff-spotlight-carlos-velez/,post,UTSA COE,,staff-spotlight-carlos-velez,0,0,publish,
14765,Two Honors College juniors receive prestigious Goldwater scholarship,"APRIL 6, 2020 â€” UTSA students <strong>Naomi Alyafei</strong> and <strong>Christian StrongÂ </strong>have been awarded the 2020 Barry Goldwater Scholarship, one of the oldest and most prestigious scholarships for natural sciences, engineering and mathematics students in the United States.

The Goldwater Scholarship Foundation awarded 396 scholarships to college sophomores and juniors around the nation who were identified as showing exceptional promise in becoming research leaders in STEM fields. This is the second consecutive year in which two UTSA students were named Goldwater Scholars as Alyafei and Strong become the fifth and sixth students in UTSAâ€™s history to earn the recognition. Both are juniors in the Honors College and serve on the Presidentâ€™s Student Advisory Council. They will each receive a $7,500 stipend.

Alyafei is a biomedical engineering major with a concentration in biomechanics. Her journey to this honor and to UTSA itself is a remarkable one. Born in Somalia, she and her family were forced to immigrate to Yemen at an early age and resettled in Indonesia during the Arab Spring. As they awaited refugee status to move to the U.S., Alyafei was not allowed to attend formal schooling for a period of three years, a time in which she came to greatly value education.
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">

â€œAs a student coming from a low-income, first-generation refugee, single-mother household, education is my hope to better my life and to contribute to the development of stronger well-educated future generations,â€ Alyafei said. She arrived in the Alamo City with her family at the age of 17. Although she initially hoped to attend medical school with aspirations of becoming a doctor, Alyafeiâ€™s love for mathematics inspired her to pursue a major that incorporated both biology and math. Biomechanical engineering, she said, was the best choice.

At UTSA she has established herself as a talented researcher and student leader within the National Institutes of Healthâ€“sponsored MARC U*STAR pre-Ph.D. research training program for minority students. Alyafei works under the tutelage of renowned UTSA faculty <strong>Rena Bizios</strong> and <strong>Teja Guda</strong> researching the musculoskeletal system, movements of the human body and diseases that affect mobility. MARC U*STAR provides support as she attends meetings and seminars, designs experiments and validates findings.

â€œI was astonished by the opportunities provided for undergraduates at UTSA, especially access to hands-on research,â€ she said. â€œResearch provides undergraduate students like me the opportunity to tackle masses of complex problems and solve it with simplicity and clarity as well as the potential to transform ideas into reality.â€

Alyafei further honed her skillset at summer research programsâ€”after her freshman year at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and, most recently, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. In addition to being an undergraduate research leader she has proved time and time again to be a student and community leader as well. Alyafei has recruited many prospective students to the MARC U*STAR program and tutored students in Greater San Antonio in STEM subjects through the Muslim Children Education and Civic Center.

These qualities and endeavors undoubtedly contributed to her receiving the Goldwater Scholarship, which she described as an incredible privilege. â€œWinning a prestigious scholarship like Goldwater says a lot about the support system I have at UTSA,â€ she explained. â€œThis is the product of guidance, mentorship and help I received from many different professors and faculty members who invested their time in making sure my professional development was moving forward.â€

Strong has also been a student luminary at UTSA and a participant in prestigious summer research programs at top universities. A chemical engineering major from McAllen, Strong is part of the UTSA Top Scholars program, which recruits students from across Texas who excel in academics, leadership and service.

Last summer Strong worked as an organic chemistry research intern at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helping to improve the synthesis of an antiretroviral used to bolster the quality of life of individuals living with HIV. Working under MIT chemistry professor <strong>Timothy Jamison</strong> and alongside an MIT doctoral student, he had a broad aim of his research to make the drug more accessible to vulnerable populations.

This kind of research doesnâ€™t stray too far from what Strong has been doing in the organic chemistry lab of UTSA professor <strong>Doug Frantz</strong> for the past two years. The bulk of that work has gone toward the development of new catalysts that can ultimately be used to create natural products, pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals in a way thatâ€™s more cost-effective and environmentally responsible.

Although heâ€™s a chemical engineering major, Strong plans to pursue a Ph.D. in chemistry with a focus in organic chemistry after he wraps up his undergraduate education at UTSA. Strong says his longtime goal is to apply scientific discoveries to solve global problems, and working as a medicinal chemist in the field of pharmaceutical research will give him the opportunity to do so.

â€œDr. Frantz has opened my eyes to the interdisciplinary requirements of the modern chemistry laboratory, which has made me feel more comfortable in my plan to pursue graduate studies in chemistry,â€ he said. â€œBeyond this, the open-mindedness and support offered by many of UTSAâ€™s faculty and staff members has helped me develop this mindset.â€

Like many students, Strong has research pursuits that have encountered recent roadblocks due to COVID-19 restrictions. He was scheduled to present his research at the American Chemical Society national conference in Philadelphia in March, but it was canceled. Strong was also awarded the Think Swiss Scholarship to conduct research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich this summer but now hopes to use the award in the winter.

Neither these changes nor the recent shift to online learning have brought him down. As a participant of four UTSA Alternative Spring Break programs, in which students connect with communities across America and volunteer alongside their peers, Strong is well-known for his positive attitude and spirit of engagement. â€œI have really seen a lot of resilience in the UTSA community and, despite the hardship, I am prouder now more than ever to be a Roadrunner,â€ he said.

Three other students from UTSA competed for the award: <strong>Cole Moczygemba</strong> (physics), <strong>Taylor Spiller </strong>(chemistry) and <strong>Shayma Toujani Mersani</strong> (chemical engineering). UTSA picked these five nominees to compete nationally according to their academic excellence, research experience and intellect demonstrated through a research essay. Their projects ranged from designing tools to predict the oxidation of metals in nuclear reactors to synthesizing new compounds that will be used in preclinical trials to treat aggressive forms of breast cancer. Students worked in UTSA labs in collaboration with organizations such as Westinghouse Electric, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the UT Health Science Center at San Antonio.

The Office of Nationally Competitive Awards at UTSA coordinated the application and review process, putting together a selection committee of faculty and staff who reviewed all nominations and provided top nominees with advice on strengthening their applications. Selection committee members were:
<ul>
 <li><strong>Hector Aguilar,</strong> senior lecturer in chemistry</li>
 <li><strong>Mark Appleford,</strong> College of Engineering associate dean and associate professor of biomedical engineering</li>
 <li><strong>Craig Jordan,</strong> College of Sciences associate dean and professor of biology</li>
 <li><strong>Gail Taylor,</strong> associate program director of RISE/MARC Programs</li>
 <li><strong>Zachary Tonzetich,</strong> associate professor of chemistry</li>
</ul>
UTSAâ€™s previous Goldwater Scholars include <strong>America Ruiz</strong> (2016), <strong>Sara Dibrell</strong> (2017), <strong>Favour Obuseh</strong> (2019) and <strong>Aldo Sepulveda</strong>(2019).

15565,"UTSA CACP alumni Brian Korte ('94, BFA-Arch) elevated to the 2020 AIA College of Fellows","<div>

(April 28, 2020) -- UTSA College of Architecture, Construction and Planning alumni Brian Korte FAIA (â€™94, BFA-Arch) has been elevated to The 2020 American Institute of Architects (AIA) College of Fellows. Brian is a partner at Clayton &amp; Little Architects and is the first Fellow among the CACPâ€™s former students. In 2020, the AIA elevated 116 member-architects to its prestigious College of Fellows, an honor awarded to only 3 percent of AIA members that not only recognizes the achievements and architectural excellence of the architect as an individual, but also elevates before the profession those architects that have made a significant contribution to architecture and society on a national level.

<strong>Where are you from originally?</strong>
I was born here in San Antonio at BAMC at Fort Sam Houston. When I was a toddler and an Air Force brat, my family moved to Colorado while my dad went to graduate school at Colorado State University, then in the mid-70â€™s we moved to Fairfax, Virginia which was a great place to grow up in and around Washington D.C. during the Bicentennial (1976).Â  Then in 1979 my parents decided to get back to warmer weather to retire and we relocated back to San Antonio and I have been here since then.

<strong>What set you on the path to becoming an architect?</strong>
Having grown up with four older brothers, I learned an early appreciation for craft and detail through observing them build model airplanes and cars. As I got older, I became quite good at it, so combining that with an enjoyment for doodling, drawing, and for making things, as well as an admiration for 60â€™s and 70â€™s ranch houses, is likely most of what pushed me in this direction.

<strong>What brought you to UTSA to pursue your Bachelor of Fine Arts in Architecture degree?</strong>
After graduating from high school, I considered 3 options: the UTSA Department of Architecture, accepting a basketball scholarship and moving away, or entering military service and becoming a pilot. Neither of the two Texas universities that offered scholarships had architecture programs, so I decided to stay close to home and go to school. I often wonder what my path would have been like had I had continued playing basketball at one of those schools instead.

<strong>What stands out when you reflect on the time you spent at UTSA?</strong>
Back in the late 80â€™s, the original 1604 campus felt pretty remote as compared to what it is today. The original core of buildings designed by Ford, Powell and Carson were a real contrast to the surrounding unspoiled woods: they were brutalist, mostly concrete, but modern. It was fun to see the campus expand over four years. My favorite building was the central power plant, which was beautifully utilitarian clad in rusty cor-ten steel. When I started, architecture was part of the Interiors Department and throughout my tenure there the school was pushing for accreditation. It was fun learning how to work in a studio environment, but during that time it was mostly a commuter school, so classmates rarely stayed in studios late the way they do now. This was a real contrast to attending graduate school at UT Austin a few years later, where students worked in studios around the clock.

<strong>What does your typical day look like?</strong>
We are currently working in a remote office setup from home, but under normal conditions I look forward to going into the office every day. I have the benefit of working with a talented bunch of architects that make the work enjoyable and bring a lot of fun to the studio. Typical days include sketching conceptual ideas or details, reviewing design or graphic progress with my team, a lot of writing and correspondence for projects and marketing, and being on the phone for at least half the day with contractors, consultants and/or clients. I normally travel at least once a month to projects outside of Texas, connecting with clients and consultants and meeting with the craftsmen that make our ideas become reality.

<strong>How would you describe your experiences working with Lake|Flato, BK.Architect, then Clayton &amp; Little?</strong>
Right out of UTSA I worked for the late Andrew Perez FAIA, who was the Director of the Architecture program at the time, then went straight to graduate school at UT Austin. Upon graduation, I worked for former UTSA professor Richard Mogas for a couple years.

I joined Lake|Flato in 1997 and worked there for just over 17 years, which was fantastic. I had a wonderful mentor in David Lake FAIA, a team of talented partners to lean on and learn from, a great group of colleagues and worked on some high-profile projects. This is where I developed the most professionally, having been given a lot of rope to push the design and detailing for my projects and develop and mentor the younger colleagues that I was fortunate to work with. Having a huge backstop and resources was fundamental to my success.

In 2014 I started my solo practice BK.Architect LLC to complete projects for clients in California that I had been working with for a decade (Epoch Estate Wines and Saxum Vineyards). During the two years of construction on these fantastic buildings, I also continued a personal passion for design and fabrication of custom furniture and hardware for these clients collaborating with my good friend, the late Max Patino (aka Cactus Max).

In 2016 I had the chance to partner with a close friend and co-found the San Antonio office of Clayton &amp; Little, a multi-disciplinary design firm based in Austin that was doing more work in San Antonio. Most of the firmâ€™s work at the time was based in Austin and spread around Texas, and I saw a real opportunity to help grow the brand and expand the geographic reach of the firm, having worked previously in California, Colorado, Idaho, South Dakota and Virginia. We now have several current projects outside of our Texas roots in California, Hawaii, and the US and British Virgin Islands. We have a great studio downtown along a quiet section of the Riverwalk in the original Greengate Building on North St. Maryâ€™s Street.

<strong>As youâ€™re licensed in California, Hawaii, Maryland, and Texas, can you share some of what youâ€™ve experienced practicing in multiple states?</strong>
Building in other states and different climate zones reflects our commitment to the study of place: climate, natural resources, cultural precedents, and historic building traditions. Each project allows us to learn from craftsmen who have expertise with their local building practices and continually teaches us to think of the environment first to inform design.

California is the most difficult state in which to work due to a long regulatory approval process, but amazing sites make these permitting hurdles all worthwhile. The most rewarding aspect to working in varying climates is being able leverage different construction techniques and applicable building science so that projects are artful, yet practical, and as high-performing as they can be.

Other than that, I just need to juggle renewing these licenses annually and maintaining continuing education requirements required by each state.

<strong>Can you discuss your attention to specialized detailing and how this shows up in most of your projects?</strong>
I like to bring an honest straightforward approach to my work, uniquely informed by circumstance, process, and ultimately the act of building itself, where each material is authentic and carefully chosen and engineered for the job it will perform. Rich, well-crafted materials are the essence of each structure, so how they come together provides focus in my work. I also fancy certain building components that often take a back seat, so I tend to give more attention to things like stairs, openings, gutters, custom lighting and hardware, and integrated mechanical systems. I feel that there is a consistency in my body of work, but also that each project feels unique to its place and owner.

<strong>Can you discuss what itâ€™s like to work on projects at different stages, such as designing, detailing, and managing? Is there a role or certain type of projects you enjoy most?</strong>
Each project is different, but working on each phase from start, at conceptual design, through its completion of construction is essential for achieving the expectations we set for our work. Conceptual design is a pretty exciting phase to start a project timeline, because it is where creative ideas are born. Some ideas come rather quickly while others take time to emerge through deeper exploration and study, and where complicated program elements begin to be puzzled together into a thoughtful solution. The stages of design development and documentation continue that layering of ideas while bringing key collaborators to the table such as consultants and contractors.

<strong>Detailing will always be an important part of the process for me since it is the backbone of my work and, as German architect Mies van der Rohe once said â€œGod is in the detailsâ€. </strong>
I enjoy all phases of the design process, but I think that the construction phase is my favorite since all of the teamâ€™s hard work leading up to that point comes together with new challenges to actually construct a vision. This is where our ideas become real.

In my role, I am involved in every step of design, but I also get to work with and mentor talented colleagues and help them realize their design ideas. This collaboration is the most rewarding aspect of my career.
I tend to enjoy projects where we have patient clients that understand that good design doesnâ€™t stop until they occupy the building, and where we can create buildings that exist within the convergence of distilled design, regional ecology, resiliency and ingenuity, and that take a step back and let the natural landscape be the star of the show.Â  I really enjoy landscape focused projects like wineries, and challenging adaptive reuse projects such as Armstrong Oil and Gas (Denver, CO) and Epoch Tasting Room (Templeton, CA). The existing salvaged structures were able to contribute such grit and richness to the project and leverage the past for the future.

<strong>Can you share some details about a few of your recent projects or notable past projects that you have found most interesting? Perhaps you could also discuss your 2009 Armstrong Oil and Gas Project, which received a National AIA Honor Award and an AISC Honor Award and the Saxum Vineyard Equipment Barn which earned numerous awards including an AIA Small Projects Award.</strong> We have several fantastic projects on the boards and under construction right now including wineries in California and Texas, a couple of vineyard barns, and custom residences in California, Hawaii, and Texas. I am really excited to see all these progress through construction.Â  One particularly interesting project is a wine cave in the Hill Country. It is essentially a private wine cellar on a clientâ€™s ranch, bored into a limestone hill and finished out with architectural concrete and some custom millwork. We are photographing this one next month.

Armstrong Oil and Gas was a pivotal project in my career. Prior to its start in 2005, I had been working with a high-profile Hollywood client for almost a decade that had a lot of ups and downs and I considered alternative career paths. AOG was a perfect storm of sorts: great client (who I am still working with today now 16 years and counting), and a wonderful late 1800â€™s building with great bones and a rich history. This project â€œhit for the cycleâ€ as far as design awards, including the AIA Institute Honor Award for Interior Architecture in 2011. It was especially rewarding for me personally, because I designed just about everything in the building and also personally made over 40 pieces of custom furniture and an art piece composed of salvaged electrical disconnects that the client stated was â€œworthy of hanging in the MoMaâ€.

Other notable projects include SK Ranch, a 4-building modern Texas villa in the Hill Country with designer Sara Story; and Saxum Winery and Epoch Winery in California, each of which has led to more high-caliber work.

The Saxum Vineyard Equipment Barn finished in 2018 has also been widely awarded, including an AIA Small Projects Award in 2019 and Dezeen Awards long list to name a couple. It is a simple, yet elegant structure made from salvaged drill stem pipe thatâ€™s sole purpose is to shoulder a photovoltaic roof that harnesses enough solar power to take the adjacent Saxum Winery and its vineyard irrigation pumps off of the energy grid.

<strong>What does it mean to you to be the first UTSA Architecture alumni elevated to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects?</strong>
It is a huge honor for me. I am not only humbled to be the first, but I never could have imagined these accolades when I started at UTSA back in 1986. Even with the professional successes or project design awards that I have been honored with to date, I still feel like I havenâ€™t achieved everything that I hope to accomplish.

<strong>Do you have any advice for current students?</strong>
The biggest challenge that I see young architects dealing with, one that they donâ€™t necessarily expect coming out of school and jumping into an office environment, is that projects are most often are non-linear. They start and stop quite often. Some projects are fickle and the environment of design can be unpredictable. Being prepared for that expectation will help curb frustrations after working long hours toward deadlines. Learning how to take advantage of the time in between is what is valuable. Another valuable skill is being malleable, not only to circumstances like these, but adapting and growing with the needs of a firm that evolve over time, continually looking for opportunities to grow personally and professionally.

14819,Knowledge Enterprise awards funding for transdisciplinary research,"MAY 19, 2020 â€”The Office of the Vice President for Research, Economic Development, and Knowledge Enterprise and Academic Affairs has awarded the FY 2021 Transdisciplinary Teams research awards. Two teams, representing four colleges and five departments collectively, were selected and will be awarded $50,000 each.

UTSA launched the Transdisciplinary Teams Program last year in response to the growing complexity of research and faculty needs. T<sup>2</sup>supports faculty to engage in scholarly research activities that foster transdisciplinary collaboration by assembling teams of researchers from different disciplines. The program also establishes a foundation for faculty to seek extramural funding, ultimately advancing UTSAâ€™s research strengths and growing new areas of opportunity.

With San Antonio forecast to have significant population growth by 2040, this yearâ€™s research concentration was <a href=""http://research.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/FY20_21-T2-Smart-Cities-Program_User.pdf"">smart and connected cities</a>, with a call for proposals that intersected technology and policy in topic areas that merge social mobility, affordable housing, water, utility and waste management, population health and community wellness, digital connectivity, transportation, e-governance and sustainability.

Earlier this year UTSA became a key collaborative partner in the <a href=""http://research.utsa.edu/2020/01/30/rdleague/"">R&amp;D League</a>, a new research and development program with the City of San Antonio, the Southwest Research Institute and USAA to address local civic challenges to enhance our neighborhoods and communities.

â€œThe idea of â€˜smart citiesâ€™ is not new, but itâ€™s gathering momentum, particularly with the advent of COVID-19,â€ explained <strong>Bernard Arulanandam,</strong> vice president for research, economic development, and knowledge enterprise at UTSA. â€œThe need for interconnected civic infrastructure with thoughtful engagement is critical to the well-being of the community.â€

The first teamâ€”led by principal investigator <strong>Wenbo Wu</strong> (management science and statistics) in collaboration with <strong>Ying HuangÂ </strong>(demography), <strong>Thankam Sunil</strong> (public health) and <strong>E</strong><strong>ric Shattuck</strong> (public health)â€”is working on â€œIntegration of Mobile Positioning, Sociodemographic factors, and Household Health for Urban Scale Energy Consumption Simulation and Planning,â€ integrating expertise from statistics, engineering, public health, and demography.

The team is developing a novel approach to understand how diverse occupant behaviors impact energy consumption, including tracking time use, mobility and health statusâ€”elements often overlooked in previous energy-use models.

Over 400 households in the San Antonio neighborhoods of Elm Creek and Jefferson Heights will be surveyed. The communities were chosen for their socioeconomic diversity. Data will be aggregated and combined with mobility data derived from cell phone GPS log files to understand how neighborhood population densities vary over time. The team will then be able to model neighborhood-level occupant behavior to better predict energy use and refine sustainable smart community/city models.
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">

The second project is led by <strong>Dakai Zhu</strong> (computer science) working with <strong>Jeff Prevost</strong> (electrical and computer engineering), <strong>Keying Ye</strong> (management science), <strong>Amanda Fernandez</strong> (computer science) and <strong>Wei Wang</strong> (computer science).

The project, â€œToward Statistical and Adaptive Learning in Edges for Smart Health Applications in Connected Communities with Security and Privacy Enforcement,â€ is focused on designing and developing a micro-service-based intelligent Edge computing framework.

The team will use digitized sensing data from IoT-enabled devices (such as smart thermometers and motion sensors) and smart applications (such as assisted living and pandemic flu status) from a large number of mixed-communities to better serve their health needs. The team is also considering the added requirements of ensuring the security and privacy of the data and the devices while providing operational flexibility and usage efficiency.

The team is leveraging statistical and learning models, scheduling algorithms and management schemes in Edge devices to support connected communities. These devices can provide effective protection for the privacy of the sensitive health data collected as well as enabling advanced security features for smart health applications.

The project will also provide education and research opportunities for underrepresented minority students.

Both of these projects align with UTSAâ€™s vision of growing data intelligence across a wide spectrum of fields to address societal challenges and to improve our communities.

14827,"For COVID-19 patients, engineering researchers develop a better way to vent","MAY 21, 2020 â€” UTSA mechanical engineering researchers have developed a new breathing tube designed to solve the problem of instability and tissue damage from the long-term ventilation of COVID-19 patients and emergency medicine.

COVID-19 can spread swiftly in the population and progress rapidly in individual patients. In turn, according to news reports, a patient may require emergency intubation and mechanical ventilation to survive. In order to place traditional ventilator tubes into the throat, doctors and nurses treating patients come in close contact with aerosolized SARS-CoV-2, often with inadequate personal protective equipment.

A critical COVID-19 patient may experience prolonged ventilation, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can lead to tracheal stenosis, tissue scarring, dislocation and stricture of the arytenoid cartilages. These injuries are more likely to occur if an oversize endotracheal tube or over-pressurized cuff is used or left in position for longer than a week.

The 3D-printed device may reduce medical workersâ€™ exposure to viruses and mitigate physical side effect problems for the patients.

The potential benefits of the new breathing tube are threefold, <strong>David Restrepo</strong><strong>,</strong> explained assistant professor in UTSAâ€™s Department of Mechanical Engineering, who is also one of the creators, â€œby limiting the exposure of health care providers to patient pathogens through streamlining the intubation process, reducing downstream complications (trachea injuries) and eliminating the need of multiple sizes.â€

Other creators of this new breathing tube include <strong>R. Lyle Hood</strong><strong>,</strong> assistant professor in UTSAâ€™s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and military science student <strong>David Berard</strong><strong>.</strong>

The project is a collaboration with UT Health San Antonio and the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research. The team filed a provisional application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which locks in the date of the invention. Once filed, the engineers have up to a year to submit a full application to the PTO for review.

â€œIn parallel with the patent, we are free to develop technology toward clinical use,â€ Hood said. â€œWe are looking to deploy our technology in animal models this year and human clinical trials for the Food and Drug Administration next year.â€

14834,Five Roadrunner scholars honored with NSF fellowships,"MAY 27, 2020 â€“ Two current UTSA students and three recent graduates have received the National Science Foundationâ€™s prestigious Graduate Research Fellowship.

This fellowship program nurtures innovation and leadership in the United States, according to the NSF, by recruiting and supporting outstanding students with high potential.

The distinguished fellowship is awarded to outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based masterâ€™s and doctoral degrees at accredited U.S. institutions.

Award winners affiliated with UTSA are <strong>Melissa Cadena,</strong> a graduating senior studying biomedical engineering; <strong>David Hall,</strong> an alumnus who is now studying biomedical engineering at the University of Florida; <strong>Hugo Lucitante,</strong> an alumnus currently studying cultural anthropology at Brown University; <strong>Aldo Sepulveda,</strong> a graduating senior studying physics and astronomy; and <strong>Carmen Varela,</strong> an alumna now studying neurosciences at the University of Michigan.

Cadena and Sepulveda are both enrolled in UTSAâ€™s Honors College.

Cadena has conducted research in <strong>Jing Yong Ye</strong>â€™s Advanced Biophotonics and Nanotechnology Laboratory, participated in the NIH/UTSA Maximizing Access to Research Careers Program and completed a research internship with the U.S. Navy in Washington, D.C. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. in Georgia Tech and Emory Universityâ€™s biomedical engineering joint program.

â€œBeing recognized as an NSF-GRFP fellow is such an incredible honor. It is wonderful to be recognized as one of the top young developing researchers and scientist in this country,â€ Cadena said. â€œComing from a minority, female, first-generation college student backgroundâ€”and to be the first member of my family to pursue a Ph.D.â€”I will be able to reach my goals with the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and it will open additional doors to my future as a researcher and leader.â€

Hall is a graduate student at the University of Florida. During his undergraduate studies at UTSA, he conducted research in <strong>Gabriela Romero-Uribe</strong>â€™s lab on topographical, chemical and electrical optimization of polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels for neural growth.

Sepulveda was a 2019 recipient of a Goldwater Scholarship, a living memorial for Sen. Barry Goldwater that awards $7,500 to foster young talent in the areas of natural science, engineering and mathematics. Sepulveda is a first-generation college student from San Antonio who conducted research on extrasolar planetary systems through summer research internships at UT Austin and the Harvardâ€“Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

â€œEarning the NSF-GRFP was an absolute honor and a validation of my abilities as an early career researcher,â€ Sepulveda said. â€œThe financial security that the fellowship provides during the three tenure years enables far more freedom in what research I will be able to pursue than if I had no fellowship support. I feel a great deal of excitement for the science I will accomplish as an NSF fellow.â€

In the fall Sepulveda will pursue a Ph.D. in astronomy at the University of Hawaiiâ€™s Institute for Astronomy, a world-class astronomical research center.

Varela is a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Michigan, studying the role of genetic mutations in the pathogenesis of early onset pediatric epilepsy. She participated in the Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement program during her undergraduate studies at UTSA. RISE provided her with invaluable hands-on scientific research experience as well as professional and leadership-developing training, preparing her to be a competitive candidate for Ph.D. programs.
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">

â€œThe NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award is an important stepping stone in this early stage of my scientific career that will give me the freedom and support to continue to pursue my research aspirations,â€ Varela said. â€œI am extremely honored and humbled by the confidence that the NSF and my current mentors have in me to conduct sound, practical science and to be a contributing member of the scientific community.â€

NSF fellows receive a three-year annual stipend of $34,000, while their universities receive a $12,000 cost-of-education allowance to cover tuition and fees. Fellows also receive international research opportunities, professional development and the freedom to conduct research on a topic of their choosing at an accredited U.S. institution.

Since 1952 the NSF has provided fellowships to individuals selected in their graduate careers based in their demonstrated potential for significant achievements in science and engineering. The NSF-GRFP is a critical program in the organizationâ€™s overall strategy to develop the globally engaged workforce necessary to ensure the nationâ€™s leadership in advancing science and engineering research and innovation.

NSF fellows have gone on to make transformative breakthroughs in science and engineering, becoming leaders in their chosen careers, and have been honored Nobel laureates.

14840,UTSA mechanical engineers adapt labs for a new world,"MAY 29, 2020 â€” A fluid is both a gas and liquid, such as air, water, steam and oil. Ordinarily, engineering students in the Griffin Thermal and Fluids Laboratory at UTSA experiment with wind tunnels, tapered ducts, valves, pipe fittings and hydraulics to observe the forces fluids produce under various conditions. With the sudden onset of a coronavirus pandemic, though, these are unusual times for universities.

â€œWe had to think creatively, taking a different approach for each lab,â€ <strong>Jeanette Oru</strong><strong>Ã§ </strong><strong>De Le</strong><strong>Ã³</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>,</strong> a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, said of the quick transition from live lab work to virtual classes in March.

She and her teaching assistants adapted the hands-on experiments for a virtual experience. After completing three of the five experiments set for the semester before the shutdown, De LeÃ³n asked students to examine the plumbing and air-conditioning systems in their own homes.

â€œThermal and fluid systems are everywhere,â€ <strong>Daniel Portillo</strong><strong>,</strong> one of De LeÃ³nâ€™s teaching assistants, said. â€œFor instance, studying their home air-conditioning units. The students already learned the math but havenâ€™t yet translated it to real-world applications. They observe whatâ€™s at hand and then write a report.â€

The feedback from students has been positive, maybe even revelatory, with the discovery that the models studied in the class are representations of more significant and sophisticated versions in residential housing setups and industrial applications.

Portillo said about half of the students live in houses and the rest in apartments. Assignments were structured so that there was no discontinuity between where the students livedâ€”for example, a study of spigots and toilets.

â€œThis information is attainable everywhere,â€ Portillo said.

De LeÃ³n was satisfied with how the quick transition toward remote learning turned out because it helped students think outside the lab. An open discussion board provided instant feedback to the professor.

â€œIt was a good first try,â€ De LeÃ³n said. â€œI enjoyed the challenge of adapting to new methods for student learning.â€

The second try began when the 10-week summer term labs started on May 26. <strong>Francisco Herbert</strong><strong>,</strong> a senior lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, is overseeing the transition of the Measurements and Instrumentation Lab.

At the end of spring break in March the professor learned of the sudden transition to online learning due to the novel coronavirus.

â€œI was thinking, <em>If students can</em>â€™<em>t come to the lab, the lab must go to the students,</em>â€ Herbert said.

Herbert found inexpensive components online, such as sensors, actuators and data acquisition systems. Together these parts can mimic the more complicated and expensive apparatus located on campus and show students the process of taking proper measurements. The cost to the students would be between $20 and $40. Herbert said the department found a way to reimburse up to $30 for the equipment.

â€œIn the end the students were able to complete their experiments at home,â€ Herbert said. â€œThey showed us functional experiments via video. And they will keep the equipment for use in many other upper-level classes at UTSA, killing many birds with one stone. The strategy worked very well.â€
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-md-12"">

The transition to hands-on coursework was not perfect because of the pandemic disruptions, Herbert admitted. Everyoneâ€™s usual productivity habits have been disrupted, but we are also adapting to a new present.

â€œWorking at home is sometimes not conducive to learning,â€ he said. â€œThere are distractions. Often students donâ€™t have a space to work. Itâ€™s tough and time-consuming to write 10-to-15-page reports.â€

Yet the students conquered these challenges. Herbert said they were happy to have these hands-on exercises at home. And they liked having all the materials online they could access.

â€œIt was easier to conduct experiments in this way,â€ he said. â€œI believe we are all better prepared for summer, now that we know what itâ€™s like to work at home. Productivity will increase because of this experience.â€

14846,Staff Spotlight: Ben Campos,"<strong>Ben Campos</strong> is the Administrative Manager of the Mechanical Engineering Department.

<strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong>
I am currently the Administrative Manager of the Mechanical Engineering Department and have been with UTSA since 2003. My previous positions were in Research Administration with the Office of Sponsored Programs and Center for Simulation, Visualization &amp; Real-Time Prediction (SiViRT).
In my free time I enjoy a variety of things such as spending time with my family when possible, catching a movie or a good documentary, and joining good friends for a casual evening. I have nine nieces and nephews who I am extremely close to and make my best effort to stay connected with them, which apparently also requires an appearance in their TikTok videos. :) I am also a huge fan of DC superheroes - Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman were what I grew up with.

<strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong>
I am currently the Administrative Manager of the Mechanical Engineering Department and, in general, my overarching responsibility is to oversee the day to day functions of the department. More specifically, I assist faculty and students with their questions or challenges and help guide them to a solution, coordinate TA's and Grader positions for each semester, manage the annual inventory, assist in the hiring of both TT and NTT faculty, process workload reports, track and update department office and lab space, assist the department chair with budget related issues, process H1B Visa and Permanent Residency's for existing faculty and post-doctorate fellows and maintain teaching supplies as well as other related things which may arise.

<strong>What is the best thing about your</strong>Â <strong>job?</strong>
Helping people and learning something new along the way.

<strong>What areÂ </strong><b>three words that best describe you?</b>
Honest, personable, and ethical.

<strong>Who was your most important mentor and why?</strong>
I never had one specific person as a mentor. I just let ""LIFE"" help me grow as a person through the good and bad experiences.

<strong>What is the most helpful advice you have received?</strong>
Learn to anticipate what your boss will want ahead of time.

<strong>If you could have dinner with one person, living or dead, who would it be and why?</strong>
So, I am going to break the rule here and say both of my grandfathers who passed away quite some time ago. The opportunity to see them one more time, have a beer and just thanking them for enduring so that I could have a brighter future than they did would be amazing.

<strong>If you could pick one superpower, what would it be?

14848,Faculty Spotlight: Drew Johnson,"<strong>Drew Johnson, Ph.D.Â </strong>is a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

<strong>Please tell us about yourself.</strong>
I was raised in Minnesota in a suburb of Minneapolis. After high school, my family relocated to Austin, TX where I studied engineering at UT Austin. I returned to Minnesota for my Ph.D. and prior to coming to work at UTSA I was an Associate Professor at the University of Wyoming. I am married and we have four college age kids, which helps with insight for college student life.

<strong>What is your job title and what do you do?</strong>
I am a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UTSA. I teach our freshmen Introduction to Civil Engineering course, our senior level Water and Wastewater Treatment course, and graduate courses to our Masters' and Ph.D. students. I also conduct research with a focus on characterization and control of water pollution. Other things I do include serving on the Faculty Senate, participating in the Urbino study abroad program, and general administrative work to help enhance the student university experience.

<strong>What brought you to UTSA?
</strong>I came to UTSA because I wanted to be a part of an aspiring university with the potential for growth. I also had a desire to live in central Texas because I have extended family in the area.

<strong>What got you into engineering? What is your firstÂ memory associated with engineering?
</strong>I chose engineering primarily because I was reasonably good at math and physics and was told (correctly) that engineers had good job placement after college. My first experience with engineering was when I worked at the USGS in Austin as a student intern. I was tasked with digitizing paper maps into computer maps so the engineers could do flood forecasting for Leon and Salado Creeks here in San Antonio.
Serendipitous now to be studying and living and working so close to these creeks when at the time I had never been to San Antonio.

<strong>What projects are you working on now?</strong>
I am working on projects in collaboration with other research groups to assess and protect the Edwards Aquifer from contamination. Contaminants of concern range from sewage to motor vehicle emissions. Field work is required for these projects and things are a little more difficult currently with the necessity of the COVID-19 stay at home orders, but we are making progress.

<strong>What do you find most challenging and rewarding about being an engineer?</strong>
Engineering is open ended with many possible solutions to explore for a wide variety of problem types. This keeps the work interesting and always evolving which I find both rewarding and challenging. Additionally, engineers have to be able to communicate the how and why of the job to a broad audience. I find this interaction with non-engineers in my community to be rewarding as well.

<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>
I have always been very curious, and I think I wanted to be an inventor. When I was young, I would disassemble items in the home to see how they worked - things like our telephone, typewriters, and pens. At the time I was not very good at reassembly, so we had a lot of non-working items in my home.

<strong>How do you like to spend your free time?</strong>
I like to run for exercise and I also play games online with friends and family. Much of my job involves sitting at a desk, so I've developed a working-with-my-hands type of hobby and do automotive mechanical work for my entire family.",,1591394138,6/5/20 21:55,https://ceid.utsa.edu/faculty-spotlight-drew-johnson/,post,UTSA COE,,faculty-spotlight-drew-johnson,0,0,publish,
14854,Roadrunners You Should Know: Student demonstrating leadership during first year at UTSA,"JUNE 11, 2020 â€” First-year Top Scholar and Honors College student at UTSA <strong>Tristan Pepper</strong> has been named a participant in the <a href=""http://www.fulbright.org.uk/going-to-the-uk/uk-summer-institutes"">Fulbright United Kingdom Summer Institute.</a> The prestigious award recognizes promising first- and second-year students for their academic potential and ability to serve as a cultural ambassador to the United States.

The award will see Pepper travel to Scotland in summer 2021 to take part in the three-week program â€œTechnology, Innovation, and Creativity,â€ hosted by Glasgow School of Art and University of Strathclyde.

For this particular award, the Fulbright United Kingdom Commission selects students who have limited overseas travel experience of four weeks or less and want their first abroad experience to be in the UK.

â€œIn the moments following being named a Fulbright Scholar I remember being overcome with gratitude and appreciation for all those who have supported me along my academic journey,â€ Pepper said. â€œTo be a Fulbright Scholar means to serve as a global ambassador and, given this immense opportunity, I intend to bridge the cultures between the U.S. and the U.K. in order to establish a greater understanding between the two in academic disciplines and cultural understanding.â€

At UTSA, Pepper is part of the National Institutes of Healthâ€“funded <a href=""https://www.nibib.nih.gov/training-careers/training-opportunities/enhancing-science-technology-engineering-and-math-educational-diversity-esteemed-research-education-experiences-r25"">Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Educational Diversity Program,</a> which helps freshman- and sophomore-level trainees develop as scholars and scientists. Pepper spent his first year working in <strong>Teja Guda</strong>â€™s biomedical engineering lab and <strong>Lyle Hood</strong>â€™s mechanical engineering lab, receiving close mentorship in research and professional development.

Participating in the UK institute will allow Pepper to step outside of the lab at UTSA and learn about how research institutions and health care services operate overseas.

â€œI seek to understand the meaning of health care in the U.K. through study and experiential learning in order to better understand how the global community may blend privatized and socialized aspects of health care into one system. Likewise, I am very interested to see how U.K. and Scottish culture affect the ways in which research is conducted and how this may direct the concentrations of biomedical research at the University of Strathclyde.â€

While he has focused on research in engineering, Pepper has made it a point to develop secondary areas of interest in educational policy so that he can learn about how it impacts research. As a freshman, he attended the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering two-day Public Policy Institute for Rising Leaders, where he was one of only two undergraduates.

He has since become a fellow with the organization, which is a position typically held by doctoral-level students. Through AIMBE, Pepper hopes to enlist a group of UTSA students to advocate to U.S. congressional members for more funding for research and education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.

He cites his own experiences growing up in schools that did not emphasize the importance of STEM, relating it to the experience of students at schools who do not have access to the resources they need. â€œThere is tremendous talent and ambition lying dormant within underprivileged school districts,â€ he said, â€œand it remains untapped.â€

<strong>Kristi Meyer,</strong> senior director for special programs and student development in the Honors Collee, said, â€œTristan is completely rewriting the rules for what a first-year student, even a high-achieving one, can accomplish as a Top Scholar. He is focused, intense and driven in his search for innovative and creative solutions to some of our worldâ€™s greatest health problems.

â€œIn addition to his research he maintains membership in club sports teams, mentors with the Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Texas, volunteers with UTSA Alternative Breaks, and has recently created a nonprofit with three other UTSA students that aims to address inequities in STEM education. Truly he has shown that he will exceed whatever expectations I might set for him as a mentor, and he will consistently set higher expectations for himself.â€

Pepperâ€™s dedication to education is being noticed in Texas as well. In June he was named a student member to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board <a href=""http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/about-us/advisory-committees/applytexas-advisory-committee/"">ApplyTX Advisory Committee,</a> where he will serve from June 2020 to May 2022. The group provides advice on the common admission applications procedures and is made up of representatives from two-year, four-year and private institutions plus one nonvoting student member. The previous representative was an upperclassman from The University of Texas at Austin.

As Pepper prepares to begin his second year at UTSA, he has the support of numerous colleges and offices in addition to the ESTEEMED and Top Scholar programs. To prepare for his Fulbright interview, for example, Pepper worked with professor <strong>John Phillip Santos</strong> of the Honors College, who has extensive knowledge of U.K. institutions from his background as a Rhodes Scholar.

<strong>Andrew Chapman,</strong> director of <a href=""https://honors.utsa.edu/onca/"">Nationally Competitive Awards,</a> said, â€œNational Award winners like Tristan routinely draw support from faculty and staff mentorship from all over the university, whether that includes application advisement on a grant proposal, doing a mock interview, or helping to foster connections with researchers throughout the world. We are grateful for UTSA faculty and staff whose mentorship and inclusion of undergraduate students in their academic lives help our students get noticed on the national level.â€",,1591911180,6/11/20 21:33,https://ceid.utsa.edu/roadrunners-you-should-know-student-demonstrating-leadership-during-first-year-at-utsa/,post,Biomedical Engineering|COE Announcements,,roadrunners-you-should-know-student-demonstrating-leadership-during-first-year-at-utsa,0,0,publish,
15578,"Dual-degree programs in architecture, urban planning slated for fall","<div>

(June 22, 2020) -- UTSAâ€™s College of Architecture, Construction and Planning will offer two new dual-degree programs at the masterâ€™s level beginning in the fall 2020 semester. The master of architecture and master of science in urban and regional planning degrees will be combined into a multidisciplinary track, while the master of architecture and master of science in architecture degrees will be combined into a research-oriented professional track.

The new dual-degree programs are designed to prepare students as future professionals and practitioners in a rapidly changing workplace. The programs are aligned with numerous schools of architecture at major U.S. universities, which have begun offering dual and joint degrees that aim to provide graduates of professional architectural programs with specific skill sets tailored for industry needs.

â€œBoth programs will draw on the College of Architecture, Construction and Planningâ€™s existing faculty expertise and will enhance all constituent programs by allowing students to explore relationships between two disciplines,â€ said Sedef Doganer, interim associate dean for research and graduate programs and chair of the Department of Architecture. â€œThis will increase the recruitment potential for the programs and lead to more comprehensive intellectual investigations and innovation.â€

According to the U.N. World Urbanization Prospects report, more than half of the worldâ€™s population lives in cities, a total expected to increase to two-thirds by 2050. The U.N. Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development in 2016 addressed issues of the New Urban Agenda, which called for policymakers, architects and planners to proactively engage in the process of urbanization across multiple scales and policy frameworks. Given the enormity of the demographic and environmental challenges facing cities, this obligation for architects and planners has never been greater.

UTSAâ€™s new dual-degree programs will focus on confronting these types of complex global urban challenges. Todayâ€™s private design and planning firms and governmental offices often utilize a multidisciplinary lens.

UTSA aims to fill this increasing demand in medium- and large-size firms by producing graduates who possess the skill set needed to conduct architectural research and, more importantly, understand how to integrate research outcomes into the design decision-making processes. This also supports the goals of the Integrated Design Initiative to fully leverage scholarly expertise across architecture, construction, planning and engineering to optimally position UTSA on the cutting edge of transdisciplinary research and academic programming.

The new research-oriented professional track combining the M.Arch. and M.S.Arch. degrees serves a recent growing trend in architectural professional practice that pairs the conventional approach to practicing architecture with a focus on applied research and evidence-based decision-making.

The accredited professional program is informed by a research agenda to better prepare students for the emergence of research-oriented workplaces and will provide students with the skills needed to conduct valid and reliable research projects within professional settings.

Students have the ability to specialize in an area of expertise that builds on existing specialized concentrations within the M.S.Arch. program (historic preservation, sustainability or urban design), while a new nonthesis option in the M.S.Arch. program is based on student internship hours within an architectural firm, which are used to develop a professional report.

An American Institute of Architects survey of the existing disciplinary landscape reveals that more than half of private architecture firms in the U.S. provide both building design and planning services, while municipal planning departments in major cities regularly engage in physical planning activities. UTSAâ€™s newly created M.Arch. and M.S.URP dual-degree program serves this emerging employment market by educating highly qualified professionals capable of combining these disciplines.

Through completion of an accredited professional degree that integrates physical building design with considerations of land use, public policy, economics, environment and culture, graduates of the program will enter the work force well-equipped to confront policy issues and a range of three-dimensional design issues.

Architecture students have an opportunity to complete their degree program in architecture while acquiring urban and regional planning expertise, while urban and regional planning students can develop physical design skills and the possibility to acquire professional licensure in architecture. This broad and highly relevant skill set will lead to more high-quality employment opportunities within the U.S. and abroad.

UTSA will be accepting applications to enroll in the new graduate programs in the fall. Competitive scholarships and assistantships are available and qualified individuals are encouraged to apply.

14912,Equity Advocacy Initiative,"<strong>UTSA Equity Advocacy Initiative</strong>

Through the <a href=""https://www.utsa.edu/strategicplan/initiatives/academic/equity-advocacy/""><u>Equity Advocacy Initiative</u></a>, UTSA will develop an overarching framework for implementing the recommendations put forth by the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Learning Environments Task Group to foster healthy and inclusive learning environments. The initiative will formally connect those efforts to the work of tactical teams on degree pathways and higher education access as a part of our fundamental commitment to diversity, inclusion and the success of UTSA students.

In support of the initiative, UTSAâ€™s colleges and academic support divisions will develop new and enhance existing activities to advance diversity, inclusion and justice.

<strong>Initiatives in the College of Architecture, Construction &amp; Planning and College of Engineering</strong>

&nbsp;

<em>Diversity in the Workplace Speaker Series</em>:Â  We are exploring ways to facilitate conversations between students and faculty â€“ and tie it to career development.Â  One example: we are creatingÂ <em>Diversity in the WorkplaceÂ </em>Â where the Student Success Center will partner with departments to sponsor a speaker regarding the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace .Â  The sponsoring department will invite Intro and Senior Design classes (for credit â€“ see below) as well as faculty.Â  We anticipate 5-6 being held over the school year.

<em>Recognizing service for advocacy in equity and inclusion:</em>Â  The Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee (DIAC) has existed in COE for 3 years but is being extended between the two colleges and continues to develop policies around diversity and inclusion.Â  Last year they conducted a climate survey, and this year we will be investigating howÂ service around advocacy for equity and inclusion (especially by URM faculty and staff) can be valued and recognized in annual evaluations and other venues. We also seek to infuse conversations around equity and inclusion throughout our curricula â€“ which are now being brought into our accreditation boards.

<em>Infusing equity and inclusion in our curricula</em>:Â  We look to include discussions throughout our curricula, and indeed theÂ accreditation boards for Engineering and Architecture have already included equity and inclusion outcomesÂ for our next round of accreditation. This year we will include a Diversity and Inclusion Statement in allÂ syllabi,Â andÂ freshman and senior classes will include attendance at Diversity in the Workplace Speaker SeriesÂ as part of their course objectives and outcomes.Â  This leads to new work with the DIAC and leadership to infuse these conversations at key and opportune parts of each program.",,1600872066,9/23/20 14:41,https://ceid.utsa.edu/equity-advocacy-initiative/,post,UTSA COE,,equity-advocacy-initiative,0,0,publish,
14914,NASA looks to UTSA to help expand field of STEM researchers,"NASA has tapped UTSA to explore creating a strategy to develop its next generation workforce. The space agency wants to create early awareness opportunities for Kâ€“12 students, in particular more females and minorities, to become interested in classes in science, technology, engineering and math, known as STEM fields.

This area of study is the foundation for developing future talent in aeronautical engineering, data sciences, unmanned systems, network communications and other related fields. The first step of this initiative involves a $50,000 NASA grant to gather data and submit a concept paper identifying STEM curriculum gaps along with a plan to overcome the problem.

The effortâ€”officially called the City-Based Integrated Engineering Training Alliance to Engage, Educate and Transform the Next Generation Stem Workforceâ€”is led by <strong>Kiran Bhaganagar,</strong> an associate professor of mechanical engineering and coâ€“principal investigator of the NASA <a href=""https://www.utsa.edu/NASA-CAMEE/"">Center for Advanced Measurements in Extreme Environments</a> at UTSA.

<hr />

<h3><em>â€œWe want all of our Kâ€“12 students in the San Antonio area to have the skill sets to be employable in STEM.â€</em></h3>

<hr />



<hr />

Along with faculty members <strong>David Akopian,</strong> <strong>Karina Velma</strong> and <strong>Chris Combs,</strong> Bhaganagar is working with representatives from 16 prominent academic, government and research institutions in the community on the alliance concept, who all wrote letters to support the initiative.

â€œEventually we want all of our Kâ€“12 students in the San Antonio area to have the skill sets to be employable in STEM-related careers,â€ Bhaganagar said. â€œOur vision is to create the next generation workforce and we want UTSA to be a model program in engineering. We want to create a mentoring network with all our alliance partners that is accessible by Kâ€“12 to UTSA graduate students in San Antonio.â€

Bhaganagar is proposing a unique, multitiered alliance training model based on the concepts of engage, educate and transform. The engage section is targeted to preâ€“middle-school students. It seeks to provide them more opportunities for activity camps and engineering clubs.

The educate portion is for community college, high school and middle school students and proposes introductory training, summer internships and online study modules.

The transform section aims to prepare college students for the workforce through focused training, dual-mentorship programs and internships.

At UTSA females make up 21% of enrollment in the <a href=""mailto:https://ceid.utsa.edu"">College of Engineering.</a> According to 2018 research by DataUSA, 15% of all aerospace engineers are female. Approximately 15% of all aerospace engineers are minorities, with Hispanics representing less than 5% of the ethnic breakdown.

â€œAs a <a href=""mailto:https://hispanicserving.utsa.edu/utsas-hispanic-community/"">Hispanic Serving Institution,</a> UTSA is well-positioned to bridge the Kâ€“12 STEM curriculum in a community as diverse as San Antonio,â€ said Bhaganagar. â€œOur university has many existing collaborative partnerships that promote mutual benefit and alignment to gain insights into how to best respond to the needs of our stakeholders via research, educational initiatives, and community outreach and participation.â€

UTSA is gathering feedback for this approach through three town hall meetings involving its 16 existing partners and new partners. The first is scheduled for October 3 and will involve Kâ€“12 academic leaders across all San Antonio school districts. Town halls will also be held for government and STEM industry sectors. All data will be compiled into a concept paper and evaluation plan that will be submitted to NASAâ€™s Office of STEM Engagement.

Bhaganagar said NASA will review the submitted proposal and determine if any funding will be provided to move forward.",,1600958412,9/24/20 14:40,https://ceid.utsa.edu/nasa-looks-to-utsa-to-help-expand-field-of-stem-researchers/,post,COE Announcements|UTSA COE,,nasa-looks-to-utsa-to-help-expand-field-of-stem-researchers,0,0,publish,
15038,"Endowed scholarship memorializes UTSA alumna, civil engineer Susan Landreth","<em>Family, employer come together to memorialize a trailblazerâ€™s memory</em>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When Susan Landreth (â€™89) passed away in the summer of 2018, her family and friends wanted </span>to honor her memory. Susan, a professional engineer with 30 years of civil engineering experience, served as a mentor and trailblazer for women in the field. With that in mind, it only seemed natural for Susanâ€™s name and memory to live on in the form of an endowed scholarship, which would benefit students studying Susanâ€™s passion: civil engineering.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusanâ€™s loss is still being felt in the San Antonio civil engineering community today,â€ said Jody Sneed, Susanâ€™s brother-in-law. â€œThat is why our family and Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc. began working together toward the creation of this endowed scholarship. We could think of no better way to honor Susan than to offer a scholarship to civil engineering students at The University of Texas at San Antonio, her alma mater. We hope these students will join the firms in San Antonio with the skills and training needed to uphold the high standards that Susan brought to the profession.â€</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Susan Landreth Memorial Endowed Civil Engineering Scholarship will be awarded to a full-time civil engineering student at UTSA, with preference given to members of the Society of Women Engineers. The <span style=""color: #535353;"">endowment</span> will provide multiple student scholarships for years to come.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the time of Susanâ€™s passing at the age of 58, she was a vice president at Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc., where she had been working since 2004. Active in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), Texas Society of Professional Engineers (TSPE), and American Water Works Association (AWWA), Susan was appointed by the governor to the Texas Public Works Response Team, where she worked on the reentry efforts in Galveston during Hurricane Ike in 2008.Â </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusan was loved and respected by her coworkers,â€ said Brenda Vickrey Johnson, president and CEO of Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc. who has known Susan for more than 25 years. â€œShe was incredibly reliable. If anyone needed anything, she would drop everything; she would never turn away anyone who asked for help.â€</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a female in an industry dominated by men, Susan found herself in a unique position to serve as a mentor for other women in the field.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusan was a trailblazer for women in engineering,â€ said Mariya Kret, a coworker of Susanâ€™s and professional engineer at Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc. â€œShe was always professional and a great mentor to so many.â€</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jeff Tondre, a coworker and professional engineer at Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc., also considered Susan to be a great mentor to many engineers.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œShe would always stop to help anyone who asked and would collaborate on projects in order to provide the best possible solution,â€ he said.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to Susanâ€™s younger sister Gail Sneed, the work ethic and professionalism Susan gained from her father, combined with her motherâ€™s determination, helped put Susan on the path to becoming a first-class engineer. Susan earned her bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from UTSA in 1989. She went on and received her masterâ€™s degree in structural engineering in 1993 from the University of Texas at Arlington and became a professional engineer (PE) in</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Â 1999. When Susanâ€™s family heard that she received her masterâ€™s degree, they were completely surprised.Â </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusan never told us when she got her masterâ€™s degree,â€ said Gail. â€œShe wasnâ€™t one to toot her own horn; she was a very humble person. Civil engineering was not a womenâ€™s field back in the day when she graduated and was working her way up. It was a constant battle to try and get recognition for her hard work but she didnâ€™t let anything stop her. Growing up with my father, they did things together that firmly convinced her that there was nothing that a man could do that she couldnâ€™t do.â€</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Throughout her illustrious career, Susan worked on civil engineering projects including public works, land development, transportation, water, wastewater, gas utilities, drainage, and other specialty projects. Two of the most notable recent projects she managed at Vickrey &amp; Associates, Inc. were the extension of UTSA Blvd. and the extension of Hardy Oak Blvd.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusan and I attended the ribbon cutting ceremony at UTSA when the UTSA Blvd. extension was complete,â€ said Vickrey Johnson. â€œShe was so excited about the changes and expansion happening on the campus.â€</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">JoAnn Browning, dean of the UTSA College of Engineering, said the Susan Landreth Memorial Endowed Civil Engineering Scholarship is unique because a family and a business teamed up to honor a loved one.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œThe collaboration between the family and employer to make this endowment possible speak volumes to how Susan touched people in all areas of her life,â€ said Browning. â€œWe are excited to award the first The Susan Landreth Memorial Endowed Civil Engineering Scholarship next year, and look forward to honoring Susanâ€™s memory.â€Â </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to the Society of Women Engineers, 30% of women graduating with an engineering degree are still active in the field after 20 years.Â  Of those leaving, 30% cite they left due to organizational climate issues.Â </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">â€œSusan was bound not to be one of those statistics â€“ the quality of her work and leadership insured it,â€ remembered Jody. â€œAnd thatâ€™s how we remember her â€“ determined, accurate, and inspiring.â€</span>",,1606754593,11/30/20 16:43,https://ceid.utsa.edu/landreth-memorial/,post,COE Announcements|UTSA COE,,landreth-memorial,0,0,publish,

15561,Temporary suspension of GRE and GMAT scores as admissions criteria,"<div>

<strong>Important announcement from Ambika Mathur, Vice Provost and Dean of the Graduate School: </strong>

(March 19, 2020) -- To best accommodate graduate program applicants, Â in consultation with all UTSA colleges and with the approval of UT System, the Graduate School will temporarily suspend consideration of the following materials for admission to its graduate programs until further notice:
<ul>
 <li>GRE and GMAT test scores</li>
 <li>Official TOEFL test scores: instead, applicants will be asked to Â  use Â  other means of demonstrating English proficiency</li>
 <li>Official transcripts: instead, unofficial transcripts must be submitted with application materials followed by official transcripts before the end of the first semester of registration.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

In the absence of test scores and official transcripts, graduate admission committees will holistically review each application and temporarily modify the weights applied to the remaining admission criteria. The same overarching goal must be maintained: Â to admit students whose application materials demonstrate a likelihood to be successful in the graduate program and, ultimately, in their chosen career.

15176,Engineering Students Place Second in Bridge Construction Competition,"A team of UTSA engineering students recently placed second in the Texas Region of the American Institute of Steel Constructionâ€™s (AISC) <a href=""https://www.aisc.org/education/university-programs/student-steel-bridge-competition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Student Steel Bridge Competition</a>. Eight Roadrunners competed, including Trinity Schaefer (Civil Engineering), Elizabeth De Leon (Civil Engineering), Evan Batton (Civil Engineering), Alexandra Sanabria (Civil Engineering), America Martinez (Civil Engineering) Daniel Vogel (Civil Engineering), Dinesh Bhatt (Civil Engineering) and Joshua Lazaro (Statistics and Data Science).

The AISC Steel Bridge Competition requires teams to fabricate and efficiently construct a scale-model steel bridge. The bridges are then load tested to ensure they can support at least 2,500 pounds. Aesthetic form of the bridge is also considered in the judging criteria. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYUVQr2jwrM"">Watch the UTSA team build</a>.

UTSA has a history of strong performances, having qualified for national competition in each of the previous four years. This yearâ€™s COVID-adjusted format saw a diminished field, meaning the second place finish unfortunately did not qualify UTSA for entrance in the national championship.

â€œIn a year filled with so many challenges, seeing our bridge come together was a triumph in itself... I could not be more proud of this team,â€ remarked team captain Trinity Schaefer. â€œThe College of Engineering is designed to not only teach us the technical aspects of our field, but also the critical thinking skills needed to apply those ideas. These skills are integral to the Steel Bridge Competition and the success of our team, as we overcome challenges in both the design and fabrication processes.â€

UTSAâ€™s Engineering programs emphasize the importance of experiential learningâ€”the hands-on, experience-based application of knowledge acquired in the classroom.

15217,UTSA's National Society of Black Engineers Chapter Receives National Award,"UTSAâ€™s National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) chapter has been recognized as the National Medium Sized Chapter of the Year by NSBEâ€™s governing body. UTSAâ€™s Chapter was also named the Texas Zone Most Outstanding Chapter.

NBSE at UTSA aims to â€œcreate a family-like growth of minority representation in STEM-fieldsâ€ and offers resources including social activities, professional development, skills training and industry networking to its members.

One of the primary initiatives of UTSAâ€™s NSBE chapter is to give back to the community. Recently, this group of Roadrunners orchestrated a food drive benefiting the San Antonio Food Bank which resulted in nearly 12,000 meals for San Antonians in need. They also work to inspire the future generations of engineering students by hosting events such as grade school science fairs and discussing STEM with younger students.

Members of the NSBE are well equipped for future success, with 38 over current members securing interviews and job offers from some of the most highly-regarded companies in the nation. Spring Bethea, UTSAâ€™s NSBE Chapter President, highlighted organization member and graduating senior James Herndon. Herndon secured 15 interviews and 10 offers for full-time employment.

Bethea urges current and future Roadrunners to consider getting involved with NSBE or other student organizations around campus. â€œI canâ€™t stress enough the importance of involvement. NSBE is an organization that heavily promotes a family environment where members are comfortable with others around them. We provide a family aspect for the minorities that account for a small percentage in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. We also provide professional &amp; personal development such as bringing financial speakers to our general body meetings, hosting mock interviews, inviting mental health speakers to our meetings, hosting technicalÂ workshops for members to work on programs &amp; software, as well as attend social events to build on the family atmosphere.â€

â€œThis award is testament to the innovation and growth our NSBE has exhibited over the past few years. I want to thank and congratulate our outgoing president Laquavious Thomas for his leadership,â€ advised Dr. Eric Brey, faculty advisor and Edward E. Whitacre, Jr. Endowed Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering. â€œI have no doubts this momentum will carry over under the leadership of Spring Bethea and am excited to see what NSBE has in store moving forward.â€

15899,UTSA Introduces the College of Engineering and Integrated Design,"The University of Texas at San Antonio today announced the formal launch of the College of Engineering and Integrated Design (CEID), effective September 1, 2021. The announcement follows recommendation from UTSAâ€™s Integrated Design Initiative Task Force, deep and broad consultation with internal and external stakeholders, and approval by The University of Texas System on behalf of its Board of Regents.

The new college combines the academic departments and programs now under the College of Engineering and the College of Architecture, Construction and Planning. It will be administratively organized into two schools â€” Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, and Construction Management; and Architecture &amp; Planning â€” and three departments â€” Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

CEID will be home to approximately 4,300 students, 117 faculty members and 41 staff members.

â€œSan Antonio is home to some of the worldâ€™s best architecture, engineering and construction firms, large and small. As a top HSI research university, UTSA is committed to serving our city and state preparing our students to succeed in the modern workforce,â€ saidÂ <strong>Kimberly Andrews Espy</strong>, UTSA Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs. â€œBy intentionally bringing students and faculty in these complimentary disciplines together in the learning environment, the College of Engineering and Integrated Design will ensure our students are well-prepared not just for their first job, but for their bold future in these professions.â€

The establishment of the new college comes after more than a yearâ€™s discussion and deliberation by UTSAâ€™s Integrated Design Initiative Taskforce. Launched in April 2020, the initiative sought to fully leverage UTSAâ€™s expertise across architecture, construction, planning, historic preservation, interior design and engineering, and optimally position the university on the cutting edge of transdisciplinary research, academic programming, and workforce preparation for students. CEID DeanÂ <strong>JoAnn Browning</strong>Â led the initiative taskforce, which included academic leaders from both existing colleges and key partner departments across campus. The taskforce also held several forums to solicit ideas from internal and external partners.

â€œThe formation of the College of Engineering and Integrated Design serves a tremendous strategic purpose,â€ Browning remarked. â€œChoosing to house these complementary disciplines in one college allows greater opportunity for collaborative research and experiential learning. Our students will have more frequent opportunities to experience a modern, integrated and collaborative workforce that will equip them with the marketable skills needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive employment market.â€

Faculty and students the College of Engineering and the College of Architecture, Construction and Planning previously have collaborated on several cross-disciplinary projects. Under the new college structure, students in the fields of engineering, architecture, construction science, urban planning, interior design and historic preservation will have more opportunities to work together, preparing them for the reality of working in their desired fields.

The formation of CEID also improves UTSAâ€™s positioning as a competitive recruiter of faculty and postdoctoral researchers, which will lead to increased investment from outside sources. â€œThis merger improves our ability to compete for extramural and large-scale grants that require interdisciplinary teams to address societal grand challenges,â€ saidÂ <strong>Krystel Castillo</strong>, GreenStar Endowed Associate Professor in Energy in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of the Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute. â€œOur centers and institutes can work together to create a potent platform for upcoming research funding opportunities.â€

An explicit commitment to experiential, hands-on learning is a cornerstone of CEID. In future years, all students will be required to complete either an internship, a research project, a study abroad experience or a service-learning initiative while pursuing their degree. In doing so, Roadrunners will develop new skills, sharpen existing ones and positively impact the world around them.

â€œThe new college structure is an exciting first step towards expanding the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources for our programs,â€ saidÂ <strong>Ian Caine</strong>, associate professor and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Planning Research. â€œCEID is positioned to become a powerful engine for transdisciplinary research and teaching, allowing faculty and students to explore the complex problems that occur where physical and social systems intersect.â€",,1624997746,6/29/21 20:15,https://ceid.utsa.edu/utsa-introduces-the-college-of-engineering-and-integrated-design/,post,COE Announcements,,utsa-introduces-the-college-of-engineering-and-integrated-design,0,0,publish,

16310,Advances in Bridge Evaluation Using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) - American Society of Civil Engineers,"According to FHWAâ€™s 2020 National Bridge Inventory Data, 1.5% of bridges in Texas are Structurally Deficient (SD). In addition, 2,841 bridges in Texas are posted with load limits, which restrict the size and weight of vehicles and in turn the flow of goods and services in the state. The state of Texas has identified 11,704 bridges in need of retrofit or repair, at an estimated cost of $6.3 billion.
<figure id=""attachment_8247"" class=""wp-caption alignright"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-8247""><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-8247"" class=""wp-caption-text""></figcaption></figure>
To address this great need for bridge monitoring and upgrade, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is looking towards new technologies to accelerate the process, reduce monitoring and assessment costs, while also delivering more accurate and less conservative load ratings for bridges. A recently funded TxDOT research project allowed a team at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) to deliver a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system that goes a long way towards alleviating the burden of maintaining an aging bridge infrastructure.

<strong>The UTSA team leveraged emerging Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technology to deliver a uniquely capably DIC system, dubbed the Civil Infrastructure Vision (CIV) system for monitoring surface deformations on structures ranging from small-scale material coupons to large-scale field structures such as bridges. The system can track deformations on virtually any point on a bridge surface as small at 1/1,000<sup>th</sup> of an inch, even when cameras used to make the measurements are over 100ft away.</strong>

17111,CEID alum wins design contest,"<strong>OCTOBER 6, 2021 - </strong>Estefania Barajas graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture in 2018 and is now working toward her graduate degree at Rice University. Earlier this year, Barajas used her knowledge to create an edible planter box. According to Barajas, â€œan edible planter is meant to grow fresh herbs, fruits, and vegetables.â€ Her impressive design went on to win the Water Collaborative of Greater New Orleansâ€™ <a href=""https://www.nolawater.org/planterboxchallenge"">Edible Planter Box Design Competition</a>.

The Water Collaborative of Greater New Orleans shared the following statement regarding her edible planter box design;
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><em>""The winner of the first place, Planta, was led by the engineer Estefania Barajas. She recently moved to Louisiana, and immediately saw the potential for social justice through urban design. Her project, apart from being structurally brilliant, reflected the core mission statement of the competition like no other.... The judges noted a â€œgood impact on the community by encouraging engagementâ€ and commended the affordability of the planter. Estefania's team wins $2000, her design will produce by Green Theory and distributed by Anova. Her design will also be featured in the National Landscape Architecture Magazine.""</em></p>
Barajas created this planter as a stepping stone towards a future without food insecurity. Food insecurity is a global issue and the United States is not beyond its reach. Specifically, her design will be distributed throughout New Orleans. Its purpose will be to aid New Orleansâ€™ communities as they continuously battle extreme storms and rising water levels due to climate change, thus affecting the citizenâ€™s ability to access resources like food and drinking water.

Estefaniaâ€™s initiative to join this competition came about from the challenges she faced in her hometown of Laredo, Texas. â€œI grew up in a food swamp/apartheid with limited access to green spaces in Laredo, Texas, a border town,â€ she said. â€œI felt/feel like no one is investing or hoping to solve issues of food security or lack of recreational opportunities in communities like my own.â€ Her drive to make a change has brought awareness to food scarcity in the United States.

Barajas' time at UTSA helped her to create a strong foundation of questions to ask herself when working on such projects like her planter box. She states that those questions included, â€œwhy does design (your design) matter? Why is this important? What are you doing for the user? For the community? For the city?â€ The answers to these inquiries are evident in her design, as she created her planter with the environment, those with disabilities, and those of various economical statuses in mind. Barajasâ€™ planterâ€™s structure is easy to operate for people of all body capabilities and is designed to be cost-effective.

Her advice for other students, such as herself, that are considering entering outside competitions is to come into the competition as she did. Not with the hopes of winning but, â€œto practice solving larger problems,â€ she says particularly the ones which the prospective entrant is passionate about. One of the challenges to take into account is, â€œoutside of school/academia, there is often not much freedom to design â€˜deliberatelyâ€™.â€ She combats this with the focus â€œto remain engaged and challenged; to think creatively.â€

During the pursuit of her undergraduate degree, Barajas also had the opportunity to volunteer. She said that, â€œas a member of Freedom by Designâ„¢, the AIAS community service program in partnership with the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), I had the opportunity to volunteer for different community gardens and get real hands-on experienceâ€¦ I recognized the benefit of simplicity but also witnessed a lack of accessibility.â€ She revealed a correlation between the way in which people are expected to acquire food now and the detriment it is having on society, and how simple changes can help to solve these issues.Â  However, her reach goes beyond the availability of food. The carbon footprint and water usage that comes from having locally grown food is significantly lower than the food culture that enables its deficit. Her goals are changing the way people can think about their relationships with food and agricultural living.

Barajasâ€™ ongoing research continues to explore the subjects that drew her towards the competition initially, including â€œfood insecurity, water conservation, border relations, and housing.â€ Her ambitions do not stop there, she says. â€œI definitely would like to teach or at least mentor students like myself, a first-generation LantinX woman, and continue to design at a firm, school, non-profit.â€ Envisioning a future in which she can use her knowledge to provide opportunity for minorities and educate future generations.

Estefania Barajas is one of the hopeful innovators rising to the dire circumstances of our world community by establishing revolutionized way of habitual living.

17135,Dr. Christopher Combs to lead research into hypersonic separation events,"October 12, 2021 - Dr. Christopher Combs, Dee Howard Endowed Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at UTSA, recently secured a grant of roughly $1.5 million to study modeling and experimental measurements of hypersonic separation events.

The grant, awarded by the University Consortium for Applied Hypersonics (UCAH) in collaboration with the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) and Joint Hypersonics Transition Office (JHTO), will fund one graduate research assistant position and two undergraduate research assistant positions over the next three years at UTSA. The bolstered research capabilities will allow UTSA to strengthen the pipeline of technically proficient professionals prepared to contribute to the development of hypersonic platforms.

The program begins this month and will run through September 2024. Lead by Dr. Christopher Combs and UTSA, it also involves representatives from OEM Lockheed Martin, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), The University of Texas at Austin and The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Research funded by this grant will help to address the design and implementation challenges related to detachable vehicular support elements in hypersonic system design.

â€œSeparation events are such a complex part of the hypersonic flight challenge,"" said Dr. Combs. ""Depending on your vehicle, you could have motor stages, boosters, or protective shrouds separating when a vehicle is moving at high speed. There are some messy aerodynamic effects that can happen in these situations that are very difficult to model. Itâ€™s exciting to bring together this talented team to use state-of-the-art experimentation to build a database to help develop computational models that will improve vehicle design. The neat thing about UCAH is that this will be student-centric, and this project will help us train the next generation of leaders in hypersonics research while solving real-world problems.â€

17201,CEID alum leads efforts to revitalize natural spaces,"MarÃ­a Fernanda Trevino, originally from El Paso, Texas, is an alum from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Since graduating from UTSA with a Master of Architecture, she has had a string of accomplishments.

Her time while earning her degree in architecture exposed her to the state of our environment. With growing knowledge of the current environmental crisis, Trevino has allowed her education to lead her to goals and passions she had not initially imagined for herself. For example, she says it was during her thesis involving a site recovery and ecology center that ""[She] realized how our decisions and choices have an impact on our environment.""

She continued her education at the University of Pennsylvania. There, she earned her Master of Science in Design, specifically, Environmental Building Design, and certification in ecological planning.

With the aspiration to make an environmental difference, Trevino's friend reached out to her regarding a fellowship opportunity at the National Park Services (NPS). As a result, she began as a Community Planner Fellow for the Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance program. Now she works as an Outdoor Recreational Planner, where some of her duties include working with communities and nonprofit organizations to develop outdoor recreation and conservation projects.

Trevino has since returned to El Paso, where she assists NPS in managing a trail segment called the Paso del Norte Trail, Medical Center of the Americas. This trail is a ""1.5-mile segment of a city-wide trail system that will improve the quality of life, health, and well-being of community members, students, and residents"" she elaborates ""The segment, which will run along a historic canal that resembles a significant component to the historic fabric of the neighborhood, will be improved to increase the safety and provide historical reference of the neighborhood.""

This neighborhood and canal, which the trail follows, carry a significant history to the city of El Paso. In addition, the trail serves to educate about the portion that was once part of Mexico before the United States and Mexico had officially compromised on the land separation. While creating the segment, they strive to protect the Latin American culture of the residents with necessary attributes such as bilingual signs and historical markings.

Trevino has also been establishing the nonprofit organization COEX. COEX's purpose is to provide opportunities for community members to learn about sustainability and environmental awareness. Other plans include a talk show called <em>COEX Talks</em> that the group started amid the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as the world slowly moves to a more in-person environment, she is open to evolving new projects and ideas.

""I never thought I would do government work, and NPS RTCA has been an amazing workplace. Not only is the work that our program does special, but the people I work with are supportive of your development,"" Trevino says, ""my advice is never to fear change, my most rewarding experiences come from opening up to different opportunities.""

Trevino is an incredible example of what can happen when someone follows their passion. Her efforts make a remarkable difference in communities such as El Paso, and it does not look to be stopping there.

17264,UTSA research helps football coaches evaluate concussion risk in real time,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021 â€”Â Football players at a local high school are benefitting from innovative concussion research developed by the UTSA College of Engineering and Integrated Design. With expertise in concussion and helmet design, assistant professorÂ <strong>Marzieh Hajiaghamemar</strong>Â and assistant professor of researchÂ <strong>Morteza Seidi</strong>Â of the UTSA Department of Biomedical Engineering are combining their knowledge to come up with an innovative approach to better understand, detect and protect players from concussions.

â€œTraumatic brain injury happens a lot, but there still arenâ€™t any techniques that assess and monitor the risk of concussions in a timely manner or helmet designs that effectively mitigate them. That led us to want to learn more about what happens inside the brain,â€ said Hajiaghamemar, the principal investigator.

Their novel concussion detection approach involves three steps: researchers collect data from football players; a proprietary computer model analyzes the information; and biomarker testing measures elevated protein levels that occur with concussion-level brain trauma.

17233,CEID students conduct testing of self-made biomedical devices in cadaver lab,"<strong>November 19, 2021</strong> â€“ UTSA biomedical engineering students are partnering with professional biomedical engineers at San Antonio-based Nvision Biomedical to get real-world experience in medical design. Throughout the semester, 17 students enrolled in Orthopedic Medical Device Design have designed and fabricated biomedical implant devices to address the health concerns of a hypothetical patient. Earlier this week, Nvision Biomedical employees and local surgeons met with the class to implant their student-designed medical devices into cadavers and test the devicesâ€™ real-world viability.

The objective of the class was for students develop a device addressing an acute ailment of the big-toe joint. Students were expected to learn about the joint in question, explore current remedies on the market, and develop an understanding of professional jargon required to explain their product and guide the surgeon through the implant process.

â€œWe were very pleased with the outcome of the lab,â€ said <strong>Brian Kieser</strong>, CEO of Nvision Biomedical. â€œThe students were fully engaged with their surgeon advisors, our engineers and each other.Â The surgeons were impressed with the concepts and felt the students had a solid understanding of the design requirements necessary for the patient diagnosis being treated.â€

This is the second time that the UTSA College of Engineering and Integrated Design has partnered with Nvision to offer the class. The previous class, conducted in 2019, also saw students develop devices for implant, however this is the first time the class has included a cadaver lab in which to implant and test the devices for viability.

â€œWhen hiring new engineers, we find the most challenging aspects for them to grasp are the interactions with surgeons in the design process, designing in true 3D space as we like to say, and the sheer volume of documentation required for compliance with FDA regulations,â€ said Kieser.Â â€œThe class aims to shorten the learning curve so that we can get them fully engaged in the work of design and development earlier, thus making us more efficient. We encourage the students to take their completed design history file (DHF) into interviews as a way to differentiate themselves from their peers. Weâ€™ve had several past students tell us that taking the class and the DHF have been the difference in receiving job offers in the industry.â€

â€œThe fact that the students understand the process of launching a medical device, the FDA pre-market notification activities and the design control procedures is a great advantage for them because they will be more prepared than any other graduate that has not been exposed to this process before,â€ addedÂ course instructor and Nvision engineer <strong>Analaura Villarreal Berain</strong>â€”a 2017 graduate of UTSAâ€™s M.S. in Biomedical Engineering.

Hands-on application such as that offered in the class with Nvision is a cornerstone of CEIDâ€™s curricula and exemplifies the dedication to producing career-ready graduates. In the previous iteration of this class, UTSA student <strong>Erin England</strong> was offered a full-time position by Nvision. She currently works at the firm.

â€œCEID is thrilled to collaborate with Nvision to offer our students unparalleled opportunities to hone their skills and emerge from their program ready to make their mark on the professional world,â€ remarked <strong>JoAnn Browning</strong>, dean of CEID. â€œWhere theory is a foundational part of our programs, hands-on experiences such as the ability to design, fabricate, implant and test these devices is an invaluable educational opportunity for our students to learn more about their targeted industry. I am thankful to Nvision for extending this opportunity to our students.â€

Students in the class will now take their notes and learnings from the cadaver lab and begin the process of refining their implant devices. For their final exam, the groups of students will be required to present their devicesâ€”complete with testing documentation fit for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) parametersâ€”to a board of practicing surgeons. At the conclusion of their presentation, the panelists will gauge student understanding through a formal Q&amp;A.

17259,CEID doctoral candidate recognized for international award,"Seyed Sasan Khedmatgozar Dolati, doctoral candidate in Civil Engineering in the School of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, and Construction Management (CECM) won the PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center) <a href=""https://peer.berkeley.edu/news-and-events/2021-reinforced-concrete-column-blind-prediction-contest"">2021 RC Column Blind Prediction Contest</a>, organized by the University of California, Berkeley.

The reinforced concrete column was subjected to a history of lateral deformation simulating earthquake excitation. The experimental test of the concrete column was conducted in 2020. The test column is representative of design practice for reinforced concrete buildings designed prior to the 1990s intended to resist gravity (vertical) loads.

Participation required the prediction of several quantities including strength, stiffness, deformation capacity, and behavior mode during a pseudo-static cyclic loading test. Prediction is made particularly difficult due to the multiple sources of nonlinearity in the response of the columns to cyclic loading. Seyedâ€™s predictions of column response and behavior yielded the highest score in the student category. PEER received predictions from a total of 116 entrants from around the world, further highlighting Seyedâ€™s extraordinary achievement.

Seyed is mentored by his faculty advisor, <a href=""https://ceid.utsa.edu/team/wassim-ghannoum-ph-d-p-e/"">Dr. Wassim Ghannoum</a>.

17324,Klesse College students designing tiny homes for disabled veterans,"DECEMBER 17, 2021 - Trinity Schaefer and Elizabeth De Leon, both undergraduate civil engineering majors, are lead organizers and co-founders of UTSAâ€™s Big Heroes, Tiny Homes project. Big Heroes, Tiny Homes--initially adopted by Humble ISD in Houston, Texas--is a trademark program dedicated to assisting homeless veterans in finding a life of shelter and security. Since launching over the summer, it has been an excellent way for the students of UTSAâ€™s Margie and Bill Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design (Klesse College) to invest in their community while working towards their desired career goals.

Schaefer and De Leon discovered Big Heroes, Tiny Homes when searching for a service project for The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Before Tiny Homes, Klesse Collegeâ€™s ASCE chapter had adopted and completed two other projects, The Steel Bridge and The Concrete Canoe. These projects consisted of teams that designed and constructed the bridges and canoes, traits that Schaefer says helped the transition into the Tiny Home Project as it consists of a similar process.

UTSA's ASCE chapter has partnered with <a href=""https://www.operationfinallyhome.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Operation Finally Home</a>, a registered non-profit that helps veterans in need of a home, and The Towne Twin Village. The <a href=""https://www.virtualbx.com/construction-preview/san-antonio-towne-twin-drive-in-to-be-reborn-as-permanent-housing-community-for-homeless-seniors/"">Towne Twin Village</a> is a new neighborhood built on grounds that previously housed a drive-in theater that â€œwill soon be reborn as a permanent housing community for homeless seniorsâ€ on San Antonio's inner east side. 

The projectâ€™s design team divided themselves into groups in July 2021, with each group exploring design ideas independently. Some focused on creating a cozy space while others are committed to an environmentally sustainable design, but all teams were asked to consider capacity for disability accommodation in their designs. The designs were reviewed on Friday, November 19th, 2021 by a panel of expert judges in various fields involved in building and designing homes to determine which design should be developed into ASCEâ€™s first tiny home.

The tiny home will be partially constructed on UTSA grounds, starting in January 2022, and then donated to The Towne Twin Village in May, where the team will complete the rest of the construction. It is important to Schaefer and De Leon that the project remains local to San Antonio. In addition, they are hoping ASCEâ€™s involvement in this project will increase community awareness of the Big Heroes, Tiny Homes initiative and help to address homelessness locally.

The unique structure of Klesse College facilitates the collaboration between students pursuing degrees in architecture, civil engineering, construction science and management, interior design, and more to achieve project goals. In doing so, students are preparing for the cross-disciplinary interactions they will see post-graduation. Schaefer said Big Heroes, Tiny Homes has been an excellent opportunity to collaborate and gain connections within the varying academic specialties she will work alongside as a future construction manager. De Leon said this project has been a fantastic way to â€œestablish a way of giving back to the community while learning. Itâ€™s a great topic to bring awareness to.â€

Schaefer and De Leon believe that Big Heroes, Tiny Homes is a highly beneficial project for Klesse College and the entirety of San Antonio. Through this project, ASCE, Klesse College and UTSA can directly support veterans in San Antonio, one of the leading military cities in the nation.

Schaefer and De Leon hope this is just the beginning of a broader project. They hope UTSA students of all majors will get involved with Big Heroes, Tiny Homes. Both are committed to continuing to support this project throughout the duration of their UTSA careers and beyond, post-graduation.

The project, a 4D Helicopter Immersion exhibit, is designed to expose Doersâ€”the name for DoSeum attendeesâ€”to the impacts of climate change.

In early discussions with The DoSeum, UTSA students involved in the EPICS program considered developing an arcade game and also had an idea to include drones.

""When discussing this project with The DoSeum, they asked us if we could combine all of the elements, so it became a helicopter simulation,"" said Vianney Aguilera â€˜21, who graduated last fall with a B.S. in electrical engineering. ""So the children will get to choose which part of the world they'd like to visit. Let's say itâ€™s the Arctic. The exhibit will simulate the helicopter taking off and then landing in the Arctic, where they will see the impact of climate change.""

17457,Klesse College hosts biomedical device Make-a-Thon,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022 - This weekend, UTSA will host the Fourth Annual South-Southwest Medical Device Make-a-Thon. Event chair, Sherry Daniel, a junior studying biomedical engineering at UTSA, is a dedicated student who has spent the spring semester organizing the 48-hour event that takes place from today through Sunday, February 27. 

Sherry explains that the event's purpose is to ""challenge [teams] to design and prototype a medical device that solves a given clinical or medical problem."" The teams will learn the issue they have to resolve at the event's start. She says the suspense of not knowing the prompt prior to the day of ""ultimately adds to the intensity and excitement of the competition.""

Sherry expressed that her undergraduate studies greatly assisted her in understanding and planning of this Make-a-Thon. ""Classes such as cellular biology and physiology have built my understanding of biological [and] anatomical relevance, biomaterials and biomechanics taught the importance of biocompatibility and functionality while product development brought awareness to the business side of things."" Lastly, she says, ""everything I've learned in my academic career is brought to life in this competition.""

It is an excellent opportunity for the students from eight universities across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to put their majors into practice in an environment that encourages their creativity and challenges their innovation. Sherry's goal is to provide a setting that allows students to transfer the knowledge they acquire while competing into real-life medical industry scenarios.

Although the competition is geared towards students pursuing biomedical engineering degrees, it is open to all majors. Thus, advocating various perspectives within the competition provides a new skill set not typically required within contrasting majors.

While the Make-a-Thon is, first and foremost, a competition, it also serves as a two-day aid to help future students succeed. While UTSA encourages Sherry's accomplishments, her ambition equally uplifts her college and the community within it. Her goals do not stop there, for this event will expand the studies of over one hundred students, many of whom are outside UTSA and even Texas. 

Sherry's desire to inspire other works and designs within this competition is a positive example of what it means to be an accomplished student. In addition, it is undeniable that her leadership characteristics will continue to motivate her after the Make-a-Thon and her time at UTSA.

17566,UTSA's Engineers Without Borders chapter developing a water distribution system for Guatemalan town,"April 6, 2022 - After transferring to UTSA in the fall of 2019, <strong>Giselle Contreras-Velarde</strong> came across an organization called Engineers Without Borders (EWB) at an engineering club event. She says, ""The whole reason why I joined EWB, to start with, is because even though engineering is a desirable career due to it being a high paying job, it is about more than just money. EWB shows there are people out there that do not have access to the things that are often taken for granted."" Giselle, now president of the club, explains what made EWB stand out against other organizations was the prospect of ""get[ting] to expand on skills as an engineer. Which was great because, in class, you learn the theory, but aren't always able to apply it."" Aside from the educational benefits of the club, she continues to draw upon its values, ""Not to mention, it is for a good cause. At EWB, you have made a commitment to a community to help them, there is no backing out of the project once you have begun.""

Currently, EWB is working alongside the community of a small town in Guatemala. EWB focuses on civil engineering to help provide a design that fits the city's current needs. Depending on the immediate necessities of the area, EWB may be assigned a variety of civil tasks relative to their club's given project, such as building homes or, what their current project in Guatemala demands, a water distribution system. Giselle and her team are creating a design that disperses water throughout the city. This system will create a reliable source of water for the people within the town, thus reducing water insecurity.

The organization has been adamant about getting water to the residents of their collaborating town despite their challenges. After the global pandemic interrupted their project, Giselle and her team got back on track. The pandemic significantly disrupted the ease of communication as things transitioned to accommodate their health and safety. However, the team was used to overcoming obstacles regarding interpersonal communication since they were initially faced with a difference in understood languages amongst the club and those which they need to convey information in Guatemala. Giselle says, ""since it is such a small community, they have their own native language apart from Spanish and English which can definitely be a barrier, but we working together to overcome that. We are there to get water to them and something like that is not going to get in the way of it.""

EWB was historically an organization directed towards civil engineers, but it has since expanded its reach and continues to do so. Giselle is pursuing a degree in electrical engineering and says they have now opened EWB to all majors on campus. She greatly encourages anyone interested now or in the future to reach out and join if interested in getting involved in a service project, no matter their desired degree. She has enjoyed broadening the reach of EWB on campus because it has benefited the communication skills of the organization's members. In addition, they are now including a variety of perspectives to achieve their goals.

Excitingly, Giselle has a career lined up for her in Austin following her graduation in Fall 2021. She says this job will differ from what she did in EWB because many projects still incorporate civil engineering themes. For example, Giselle will be using her electrical engineering degree to help create semiconductors for various devices such as computers, cell phones, and smart fridges. Although she is ready to graduate and begin building her career, Giselle also hopes to continue participating in service projects similar to those in EWB in the future.

17583,How a UTSA grad went from flunking out to designing a lower-cost robotic prosthetic hand,"April 15, 2022 - Three years ago it was nothing more than a school project and proof of concept â€” the second-place winner at a university showcase contest â€” but it grabbed headlines as far away as the United Kingdom.

For their senior project at UTSA, Ryan Saavedra and two classmates had built a robotic prosthetic hand for less than $700, a fraction of what many prosthetics like it on the market cost. Their 3D-printed model, offering artificial intelligence-enhanced bionic prosthetics at an affordable price, dangled the prospect of upheaval in a multibillion-dollar industry. Reporters asked Saavedra, whatâ€™s next?

â€œI had absolutely no idea,â€ he said, recalling the experience this week. â€œI was an undergrad with no prior experience of building a company or commercializing a medical device.â€ In fact, he had no plans to do so.

17607,Klesse College continues to build reputation in corrosion research,"APRIL 27, 2022 - The UTSA Corrosion Research Laboratory founded in 2016 by <strong>Brendy Rincon Troconis</strong>, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, integrates experimental approaches with accelerated degradation through harsh environments (salts, temperature, humidity) and extensive materials characterization with computational modelling to better understand corrosion and assist industrial partners in mitigating its effects. Throughout 2021, Rincon Troconis and her team of student researchers, collaborators, and visiting scientists secured research funding from five governmental and industry partners.

<strong>Addressing corrosion challenges head on</strong>

The UTSA Corrosion Laboratory, in collaboration with <strong>David Restrepo</strong> (co-principal investigator and assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering), is supporting the US Office of Naval Research by investigating the effect of stress on corrosion kinetics. â€œA report from aircrafts teardowns showed that nearly 80% of cracks on military aircrafts have been found in close proximity to corrosion sites,â€ said Rincon Troconis. â€œConsidering that aircrafts are also exposed to mechanical stress, itâ€™s important to best understand how they affect corrosion. This can be done through the evaluation of corrosion and attack on structural alloys in relevant conditions. All this information can feed structural life management tools and lead to more efficient maintenance schedules.â€   

The UTSA Corrosion Laboratory is also supporting BASF | Chemetall to explore surface treatments used in autobody paneling and their interaction with epoxy adhesives used in the production of vehicles. In this project, an improved coating adhesion testing protocol is being developed to quantitatively measure adhesion strength under relevant conditions.

<strong>Improving the safety and durability of construction materials</strong>

Visiting Professor Oladis Troconis de Rincon (an expert in corrosion in reinforced concrete) and the Corrosion Laboratory have also partnered with Texas-based Twin Hawk LLC to refine a commercial grade coating that minimizes corrosion and improves the durability of the reinforced concrete over time. â€œWe have previously demonstrated the efficiency of Twin Hawkâ€™s product and are now bringing the chemical production onto campus to optimize the surface preparation and coating process parameters, and expand the testing to include accelerated corrosion chambers and field testing related to reinforced concrete applicationsâ€ said Rincon Troconis. Additionally, as part of the Transport Consortium of South-Central States (Tran-SET), the same research team is collaborating with Universidad de Costa Rica and Texas A&M University to test an environmentally sustainable corrosion inhibitor to increase the durability of reinforced concrete in a sustainable way, while minimizing risks to humans and the broader environment.

<strong>Looking after the next generation of scientists</strong>

UTSA has been serving proudly as Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and <a href=""https://www.utsa.edu/today/2021/12/story/utsa-attains-carnegie-r1-classification.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">recently achieved the rank of Carnegie R1 in recognition of its scholarly excellence</a>.

""Without the support offered, our students likely would not have as much flexibility to maximize their college experience and engage in critical opportunities for academic, professional and personal development. The impact of these scholarships is immense.""

Klesse College's curricula are designed to encourage students to engage in hands-on experiential learning. Options such as internships, undergraduate research projects, community service or study abroad allow students to pair their classroom-acquired knowledge with problem solving skills and perseverance to prepare themselves for the challenges of their chosen professions or to pursue an advanced degree. However, a significant portion of UTSA's undergraduate students work full-time due to financial circumstances, making these enriching but often unpaid opportunities difficult to access.

""I wouldn't be the student I am, or even weeks away from graduation, without the scholarships I've received while at UTSA,"" remarked <strong>Alexandra Malone</strong>, a senior studying biomedical engineering. ""They have allowed me opportunities I otherwise wouldn't have as I would have been working. I have taken on internships and been involved in student organizations and undergraduate research.""

""This scholarship has meant to the world to me,"" added <strong>Tanya Cruz</strong>, also a senior biomedical engineering student. ""It has provided freedom to work less and to pursue other opportunities such as research on and off campus and taking on internships here in San Antonio. These have allowed me to seek experiences that prepare me for my goal of enrolling in a Ph.D. program and to make sure that's what I want to do. Thank you so much to our donors who are fostering the next generations of leaders, it means so much to us.""

Klesse College students supported by scholarships in the 2021-2022 academic year ranged from first-year undergraduates to doctoral students. 75 undergraduates (five freshmen, 18 sophomores, 22 juniors and 40 seniors), two post-baccalaureate, 11 master's students, one doctoral student received financial aid through scholarships derived from donors' gifts.

""A significant portion of the amazing things achieved by our Klesse College students are made possible by scholarship donations,"" said <strong>JoAnn Browning</strong>, dean of Klesse College. ""This event was a great opportunity for our donors to meet their outstanding students and our students to personally thank those who have helped them throughout their college journeys. We work hard to engage in our communities and it's great to see the support our community gives back to the college.""

Klesse College also recently announced the successes of UTSA's Giving Day 2022. A total of $76,101 was raised from 163 unique donors, making Klesse College the most financially supported academic college throughout the event.

17654,Klesse College's Rathbone receives National Science Foundation's CAREER Award,"MAY 9, 2022 â€“ <strong>Christopher Rathbone</strong>, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in UTSAâ€™s Margie and Bill Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design (Klesse College) recently received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

CAREER is the NSFâ€™s most prestigious award designed to support early-career faculty who demonstrate potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. Faculty members may apply for the award to recognize research activities that set a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in their academic discipline.

Rathboneâ€™s CAREER project will examine adipocytes (fat cells) in diabetic skeletal muscle during muscle repair and regeneration. An in vitro model of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle (TE-SkM) will be used as a tool to deconstruct the role of adipocytes in skeletal muscle using conditions that mimic diabetes and muscle injury.

The knowledge and experience gained from this work will lead to the development of more comprehensive tissue engineering models for understanding and treating skeletal muscle complications. Rathbone believes that the findings generated with this work will extend to the engineering of tissues beyond skeletal muscle. As a result of this award, Rathbone will receive $503,000 of funding over the next five years. 

â€œAn NSF CAREER award is a highly coveted designation,â€ said <strong>JoAnn Browning</strong>, dean of Klesse College. â€œChris has worked hard to achieve this and has made significant contributions to the research and teaching functions of our college. Congratulations on this award, I look forward to seeing his career progress.â€

â€œDr. Rathboneâ€™s is an outstanding researcher, but also a dedicated educator who is excellent in the classroom and committed to the success of our students,â€ said <strong>Eric Brey</strong>, chair of UTSAâ€™s Department of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. â€œHis work will allow for a better understanding of diabetes and metabolic disease which pose significant challenges locally and around the world. Dr. Rathbone is highly deserving of this recognition.â€ 

In receiving an NSF CAREER award, Rathbone joins the ranks of two other biomedical engineering professors, Teja Guda and Gabriela Romero-Uribe, who previously received this prestigious accolade. Klesse Collegeâ€™s faculty also includes four other NSF CAREER awardees, Wei Gao (mechanical engineering), Ram Krishnan (electrical engineering) Nikolaos Gatsis (electrical engineering) and Yanmin Gong (electrical engineering).
