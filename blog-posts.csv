15267,2018 Rising Star Award in Urban and Regional Planning: Levar Martin,"<em>The UTSA CACPâ€™s Rising Star Distinguished Alumni are those who are demonstrating bright promise in the first decade of their professional lives. They show evidence of outstanding professional progression, such as licensure in architecture or position increase over time in any field, and evidence of service to their communities or professions. A native of San Antonio, Texas, Levar earned his Master of Science in Urban and Regional Planning degree from UTSA in 2014. He is currently National Director of Programs for the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB), a position he began in January 2017. He began with NALCAB in 2011 as a Program Assistant â€” at the same time he began his masterâ€™s degree at UTSA â€” and has held several positions culminating in his current one. At NALCAB, he oversees the Equitable Neighborhood Development Program. Levar has continually worked to advance economic mobility for low- and moderate-income persons and was recently accepted into the NeighborWorks America, Achieving Excellence Executive Leadership program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</em>

<strong>On his time spent at UTSA:</strong>

After completing my undergraduate degree in Sociology, with a concentration in Urban Studies, from Trinity University, I wanted to pursue a degree in urban planning. The semester after I graduated from Trinity, UTSA launched the Masters in Urban and Regional Planning program and I wanted to learn in a program that was connected to my home town. What stands out to me was the connection that the city had to practitioners to learn from those in the planning profession along with the expertise of the UTSA professors.

<strong>On working with NALCAB for the last seven years:</strong>

My experience has been challenging and rewarding. We support real estate development, small business investment and financial capability programming through more than 120 local nonprofits in 40 states and Washington, DC. We also provide funding to organizations to develop Equitable Neighborhood Development Plans to respond to changes they are experiencing in their communities. It is challenging in that many of the communities we serve have been historically capital neglected and continue to face poverty and a lack of wealth-building opportunities. It is rewarding as our work supports low- to - moderate income communities in building economic assets and wealth.

<strong>His typical workday:</strong>

My day consists of guiding the implementation of our organizationâ€™s asset building strategies, usually quite a few meetings, and communicating with funders, government agencies, and municipalities around economic development, affordable housing, financial capability and small-business investment programs, contracts, and initiatives.

<strong>On NALCABâ€™s Equitable Neighborhood Development Program and the different roles he has held, such as Senior Program Manager and Program Director:</strong>

Our Equitable Neighborhood Development program area came from responding to the needs of the communities we serve. Many of our member organizations across the U.S. were telling us their neighborhoods were changing significantly and they did not quite understand why or how to respond to those changes. Lots of research exists around reacting to or responding to neighborhood change, including gentrification and displacement after it has already occurred, but there is limited research on how to get ahead of the changes so that existing residents and businesses can also benefit from the economic development and investment that is coming into these historically capital neglected communities. This led us to deeply engage in analyzing and anticipating neighborhood change, including displacement and gentrification. As Senior Program Manager and then Program Director of Equitable Neighborhood Development, I had the opportunity to lead the design and implementation of our programmatic approach and methodology of understanding and getting ahead of neighborhood change across multiple U.S. cities. This includes, but is not limited to, data analysis, GIS mapping, community engagement and facilitation, developing training curriculum, conducting multiple site visits, and advancing fair housing policy and advocacy.

<strong>His advice for current students:</strong>

Dive into the work, make yourself uncomfortable and meet as many people in the field as possible. Attend symposiums, conferences, and events. Ask people to lunch or coffee to get to know what they do and to understand what type of work is out there. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help and do something you enjoy.

15270,2018 Meritorious Global Influence Award: Nikki Gledhill,"<em>The UTSA CACPâ€™s Meritorious Global Influence Award honorsÂ </em><em>an alumni</em><em>Â in any class who has shown evidence of international and global reach in their professional responsibilities. An Austin, Texas native who currently resides in Spring Branch, Nikki Gledhill earned her Bachelor of Science in Interior Design from UTSA in 2006. She is currently CEO and VIP Aircraft Interior Designer at MBG International Design, LLC, which was established in 2009. She has contributed to the interior design of jets for MGM Resorts, Sands Group, Google, United Arab Emiratesâ€™ President, the Japanese government, and confidential Chinese and Saudi Arabian clients. Nikki was named the 2017 Designer to Watch from Jet Moda Magazine and earned Top 10 designs of the decade 2007-2017 from Business Jet Interiors in the Airbus 340-500 category. She was shorted listed for Pegasus by the International Yacht and Aviation Awards in 2013.</em>

<strong>On</strong><strong>Â her time spent at UTSA:</strong>

My time at UTSA started at the 1604 campus with my freshman and sophomore studio classes. The beginning of Junior year was when the College of Architecture was moved to the downtown campus. I graduated in 2006. I remember long nights and professors that genuinely cared about our well being and our success, even after graduation.

<strong>How she got into aircraft interior design:</strong>

Immediately following my gradation in 2006, I was hired by an aircraft design and modification company in San Antonio. I worked on numerous different aircrafts frames from Boeing and Airbus until 2011, when I left to pursue MBG full time where I continued working with Airbus and Boeing along with smaller aircraft such as Gulfstream, Citation, Embraer, and Bombardier.

<strong>On working with MBG International Design, LLC:</strong>

Every project is unique and one-of-a-kind. Each client is distinctive and desires something special and more enhanced than the next person. Custom, highly detailed, and state-of-the-art are always the understood reality for every project.

<strong>Her typical workday:</strong>

Many days start before the sun even rises. Checking email that has been delivered while I slept. The majority of my clients are overseas and their days are different and almost over once I wake in the morning. A lot of work and correspondence happens overnight. Therefore, many mornings are for playing catch up. After conquering emails, I generally start my task list for the day. Which can include, sketching, working on material specifications, selecting materials, redlining elevation packages or marking up 3D renderings.

<strong>Her advice for current students:</strong>

Soak it all in. The knowledge, the all-nighters, the friendships, itâ€™s all part of the process. It may seem overwhelming, the days and nights in your design studios, but that never changes. Itâ€™s setting you up for the years in your career where you will do the same. Chase after the dream, not the money. Youâ€™ll find your most comfortable and rewarding job may not be the highest-paying one.

15561,Temporary suspension of GRE and GMAT scores as admissions criteria,"<div>

<strong>Important announcement from Ambika Mathur, Vice Provost and Dean of the Graduate School: </strong>

(March 19, 2020) -- To best accommodate graduate program applicants, Â in consultation with all UTSA colleges and with the approval of UT System, the Graduate School will temporarily suspend consideration of the following materials for admission to its graduate programs until further notice:
<ul>
 <li>GRE and GMAT test scores</li>
 <li>Official TOEFL test scores: instead, applicants will be asked to Â  use Â  other means of demonstrating English proficiency</li>
 <li>Official transcripts: instead, unofficial transcripts must be submitted with application materials followed by official transcripts before the end of the first semester of registration.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

In the absence of test scores and official transcripts, graduate admission committees will holistically review each application and temporarily modify the weights applied to the remaining admission criteria. The same overarching goal must be maintained: Â to admit students whose application materials demonstrate a likelihood to be successful in the graduate program and, ultimately, in their chosen career.

17324,Klesse College students designing tiny homes for disabled veterans,"DECEMBER 17, 2021 - Trinity Schaefer and Elizabeth De Leon, both undergraduate civil engineering majors, are lead organizers and co-founders of UTSAâ€™s Big Heroes, Tiny Homes project. Big Heroes, Tiny Homes--initially adopted by Humble ISD in Houston, Texas--is a trademark program dedicated to assisting homeless veterans in finding a life of shelter and security. Since launching over the summer, it has been an excellent way for the students of UTSAâ€™s Margie and Bill Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design (Klesse College) to invest in their community while working towards their desired career goals.

Schaefer and De Leon discovered Big Heroes, Tiny Homes when searching for a service project for The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Before Tiny Homes, Klesse Collegeâ€™s ASCE chapter had adopted and completed two other projects, The Steel Bridge and The Concrete Canoe. These projects consisted of teams that designed and constructed the bridges and canoes, traits that Schaefer says helped the transition into the Tiny Home Project as it consists of a similar process.

UTSA's ASCE chapter has partnered with <a href=""https://www.operationfinallyhome.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Operation Finally Home</a>, a registered non-profit that helps veterans in need of a home, and The Towne Twin Village. The <a href=""https://www.virtualbx.com/construction-preview/san-antonio-towne-twin-drive-in-to-be-reborn-as-permanent-housing-community-for-homeless-seniors/"">Towne Twin Village</a> is a new neighborhood built on grounds that previously housed a drive-in theater that â€œwill soon be reborn as a permanent housing community for homeless seniorsâ€ on San Antonio's inner east side. 

The projectâ€™s design team divided themselves into groups in July 2021, with each group exploring design ideas independently. Some focused on creating a cozy space while others are committed to an environmentally sustainable design, but all teams were asked to consider capacity for disability accommodation in their designs. The designs were reviewed on Friday, November 19th, 2021 by a panel of expert judges in various fields involved in building and designing homes to determine which design should be developed into ASCEâ€™s first tiny home.

The tiny home will be partially constructed on UTSA grounds, starting in January 2022, and then donated to The Towne Twin Village in May, where the team will complete the rest of the construction. It is important to Schaefer and De Leon that the project remains local to San Antonio. In addition, they are hoping ASCEâ€™s involvement in this project will increase community awareness of the Big Heroes, Tiny Homes initiative and help to address homelessness locally.

The unique structure of Klesse College facilitates the collaboration between students pursuing degrees in architecture, civil engineering, construction science and management, interior design, and more to achieve project goals. In doing so, students are preparing for the cross-disciplinary interactions they will see post-graduation. Schaefer said Big Heroes, Tiny Homes has been an excellent opportunity to collaborate and gain connections within the varying academic specialties she will work alongside as a future construction manager. De Leon said this project has been a fantastic way to â€œestablish a way of giving back to the community while learning. Itâ€™s a great topic to bring awareness to.â€

Schaefer and De Leon believe that Big Heroes, Tiny Homes is a highly beneficial project for Klesse College and the entirety of San Antonio. Through this project, ASCE, Klesse College and UTSA can directly support veterans in San Antonio, one of the leading military cities in the nation.

Schaefer and De Leon hope this is just the beginning of a broader project. They hope UTSA students of all majors will get involved with Big Heroes, Tiny Homes. Both are committed to continuing to support this project throughout the duration of their UTSA careers and beyond, post-graduation.
