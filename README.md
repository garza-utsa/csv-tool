# csv-tool

Quick and dirty scripting for creating blocks and pages utilizing the Cascade REST API.

Configure your Cascade instance in .env, use env.sample as a template.

Each script has a corresponding npm run target in package.json.  The script names should be descriptive in the type of operations they do.

A majority of the scripts utilize a CSV formatted input file in order to target what data needs to be updated/modified in Cascade.
